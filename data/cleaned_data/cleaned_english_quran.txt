1|1|in the name of allah the entirely merciful the especially merciful
1|2|all praise is due to allah lord of the worlds
1|3|the entirely merciful the especially merciful
1|4|sovereign of the day of recompense
1|5|it is you we worship and you we ask for help
1|6|guide us to the straight path
1|7|the path of those upon whom you have bestowed favor not of those who have evoked your anger or of those who are astray
2|1|alif lam meem
2|2|this is the book about which there is no doubt a guidance for those conscious of allah
2|3|who believe in the unseen establish prayer and spend out of what we have provided for them
2|4|and who believe in what has been revealed to you o muhammad and what was revealed before you and of the hereafter they are certain in faith
2|5|those are upon right guidance from their lord and it is those who are the successful
2|6|indeed those who disbelieve it is all the same for them whether you warn them or do not warn them they will not believe
2|7|allah has set a seal upon their hearts and upon their hearing and over their vision is a veil and for them is a great punishment
2|8|and of the people are some who say we believe in allah and the last day but they are not believers
2|9|they think to deceive allah and those who believe but they deceive not except themselves and perceive it not
2|10|in their hearts is disease so allah has increased their disease and for them is a painful punishment because they habitually used to lie
2|11|and when it is said to them do not cause corruption on the earth they say we are but reformers
2|12|unquestionably it is they who are the corrupters but they perceive it not
2|13|and when it is said to them believe as the people have believed they say should we believe as the foolish have believed unquestionably it is they who are the foolish but they know it not
2|14|and when they meet those who believe they say we believe but when they are alone with their evil ones they say indeed we are with you we were only mockers
2|15|but allah mocks them and prolongs them in their transgression while they wander blindly
2|16|those are the ones who have purchased error in exchange for guidance so their transaction has brought no profit nor were they guided
2|17|their example is that of one who kindled a fire but when it illuminated what was around him allah took away their light and left them in darkness so they could not see
2|18|deaf dumb and blind so they will not return to the right path
2|19|or it is like a rainstorm from the sky within which is darkness thunder and lightning they put their fingers in their ears against the thunderclaps in dread of death but allah is encompassing of the disbelievers
2|20|the lightning almost snatches away their sight every time it lights the way for them they walk therein but when darkness comes over them they stand still and if allah had willed he could have taken away their hearing and their sight indeed allah is over all things competent
2|21|o mankind worship your lord who created you and those before you that you may become righteous
2|22|he who made for you the earth a bed spread out and the sky a ceiling and sent down from the sky rain and brought forth thereby fruits as provision for you so do not attribute to allah equals while you know that there is nothing similar to him
2|23|and if you are in doubt about what we have sent down upon our servant muhammad then produce a surah the like thereof and call upon your witnesses other than allah if you should be truthful
2|24|but if you do not and you will never be able to then fear the fire whose fuel is men and stones prepared for the disbelievers
2|25|and give good tidings to those who believe and do righteous deeds that they will have gardens in paradise beneath which rivers flow whenever they are provided with a provision of fruit therefrom they will say this is what we were provided with before and it is given to them in likeness and they will have therein purified spouses and they will abide therein eternally
2|26|indeed allah is not timid to present an example that of a mosquito or what is smaller than it and those who have believed know that it is the truth from their lord but as for those who disbelieve they say what did allah intend by this as an example he misleads many thereby and guides many thereby and he misleads not except the defiantly disobedient
2|27|who break the covenant of allah after contracting it and sever that which allah has ordered to be joined and cause corruption on earth it is those who are the losers
2|28|how can you disbelieve in allah when you were lifeless and he brought you to life then he will cause you to die then he will bring you back to life and then to him you will be returned
2|29|it is he who created for you all of that which is on the earth then he directed himself to the heaven his being above all creation and made them seven heavens and he is knowing of all things
2|30|and mention o muhammad when your lord said to the angels indeed i will make upon the earth a successive authority they said will you place upon it one who causes corruption therein and sheds blood while we declare your praise and sanctify you allah said indeed i know that which you do not know
2|31|and he taught adam the names all of them then he showed them to the angels and said inform me of the names of these if you are truthful
2|32|they said exalted are you we have no knowledge except what you have taught us indeed it is you who is the knowing the wise
2|33|he said o adam inform them of their names and when he had informed them of their names he said did i not tell you that i know the unseen aspects of the heavens and the earth and i know what you reveal and what you have concealed
2|34|and mention when we said to the angels prostrate before adam so they prostrated except for iblees he refused and was arrogant and became of the disbelievers
2|35|and we said o adam dwell you and your wife in paradise and eat therefrom in ease and abundance from wherever you will but do not approach this tree lest you be among the wrongdoers
2|36|but satan caused them to slip out of it and removed them from that condition in which they had been and we said go down all of you as enemies to one another and you will have upon the earth a place of settlement and provision for a time
2|37|then adam received from his lord some words and he accepted his repentance indeed it is he who is the accepting of repentance the merciful
2|38|we said go down from it all of you and when guidance comes to you from me whoever follows my guidance there will be no fear concerning them nor will they grieve
2|39|and those who disbelieve and deny our signs those will be companions of the fire they will abide therein eternally
2|40|o children of israel remember my favor which i have bestowed upon you and fulfill my covenant upon you that i will fulfill your covenant from me and be afraid of only me
2|41|and believe in what i have sent down confirming that which is already with you and be not the first to disbelieve in it and do not exchange my signs for a small price and fear only me
2|42|and do not mix the truth with falsehood or conceal the truth while you know it
2|43|and establish prayer and give zakah and bow with those who bow in worship and obedience
2|44|do you order righteousness of the people and forget yourselves while you recite the scripture then will you not reason
2|45|and seek help through patience and prayer and indeed it is difficult except for the humbly submissive to allah
2|46|who are certain that they will meet their lord and that they will return to him
2|47|o children of israel remember my favor that i have bestowed upon you and that i preferred you over the worlds
2|48|and fear a day when no soul will suffice for another soul at all nor will intercession be accepted from it nor will compensation be taken from it nor will they be aided
2|49|and recall when we saved your forefathers from the people of pharaoh who afflicted you with the worst torment slaughtering your newborn sons and keeping your females alive and in that was a great trial from your lord
2|50|and recall when we parted the sea for you and saved you and drowned the people of pharaoh while you were looking on
2|51|and recall when we made an appointment with moses for forty nights then you took for worship the calf after him while you were wrongdoers
2|52|then we forgave you after that so perhaps you would be grateful
2|53|and recall when we gave moses the scripture and criterion that perhaps you would be guided
2|54|and recall when moses said to his people o my people indeed you have wronged yourselves by your taking of the calf for worship so repent to your creator and kill yourselves that is best for all of you in the sight of your creator then he accepted your repentance indeed he is the accepting of repentance the merciful
2|55|and recall when you said o moses we will never believe you until we see allah outright so the thunderbolt took you while you were looking on
2|56|then we revived you after your death that perhaps you would be grateful
2|57|and we shaded you with clouds and sent down to you manna and quails saying eat from the good things with which we have provided you and they wronged us not but they were only wronging themselves
2|58|and recall when we said enter this city and eat from it wherever you will in ease and abundance and enter the gate bowing humbly and say relieve us of our burdens we will then forgive your sins for you and we will increase the doers of good in goodness and reward
2|59|but those who wronged changed those words to a statement other than that which had been said to them so we sent down upon those who wronged a punishment from the sky because they were defiantly disobeying
2|60|and recall when moses prayed for water for his people so we said strike with your staff the stone and there gushed forth from it twelve springs and every people knew its watering place eat and drink from the provision of allah and do not commit abuse on the earth spreading corruption
2|61|and recall when you said o moses we can never endure one kind of food so call upon your lord to bring forth for us from the earth its green herbs and its cucumbers and its garlic and its lentils and its onions moses said would you exchange what is better for what is less go into any settlement and indeed you will have what you have asked and they were covered with humiliation and poverty and returned with anger from allah upon them that was because they repeatedly disbelieved in the signs of allah and killed the prophets without right that was because they disobeyed and were habitually transgressing
2|62|indeed those who believed and those who were jews or christians or sabeans before prophet muhammad those among them who believed in allah and the last day and did righteousness will have their reward with their lord and no fear will there be concerning them nor will they grieve
2|63|and recall when we took your covenant o children of israel to abide by the torah and we raised over you the mount saying take what we have given you with determination and remember what is in it that perhaps you may become righteous
2|64|then you turned away after that and if not for the favor of allah upon you and his mercy you would have been among the losers
2|65|and you had already known about those who transgressed among you concerning the sabbath and we said to them be apes despised
2|66|and we made it a deterrent punishment for those who were present and those who succeeded them and a lesson for those who fear allah
2|67|and recall when moses said to his people indeed allah commands you to slaughter a cow they said do you take us in ridicule he said i seek refuge in allah from being among the ignorant
2|68|they said call upon your lord to make clear to us what it is moses said allah says it is a cow which is neither old nor virgin but median between that so do what you are commanded
2|69|they said call upon your lord to show us what is her color he said he says it is a yellow cow bright in color pleasing to the observers
2|70|they said call upon your lord to make clear to us what it is indeed all cows look alike to us and indeed we if allah wills will be guided
2|71|he said he says it is a cow neither trained to plow the earth nor to irrigate the field one free from fault with no spot upon her they said now you have come with the truth so they slaughtered her but they could hardly do it
2|72|and recall when you slew a man and disputed over it but allah was to bring out that which you were concealing
2|73|so we said strike the slain man with part of it thus does allah bring the dead to life and he shows you his signs that you might reason
2|74|then your hearts became hardened after that being like stones or even harder for indeed there are stones from which rivers burst forth and there are some of them that split open and water comes out and there are some of them that fall down for fear of allah and allah is not unaware of what you do
2|75|do you covet the hope o believers that they would believe for you while a party of them used to hear the words of allah and then distort the torah after they had understood it while they were knowing
2|76|and when they meet those who believe they say we have believed but when they are alone with one another they say do you talk to them about what allah has revealed to you so they can argue with you about it before your lord then will you not reason
2|77|but do they not know that allah knows what they conceal and what they declare
2|78|and among them are unlettered ones who do not know the scripture except in wishful thinking but they are only assuming
2|79|so woe to those who write the scripture with their own hands then say this is from allah in order to exchange it for a small price woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for what they earn
2|80|and they say never will the fire touch us except for a few days say have you taken a covenant with allah for allah will never break his covenant or do you say about allah that which you do not know
2|81|yes whoever earns evil and his sin has encompassed him those are the companions of the fire they will abide therein eternally
2|82|but they who believe and do righteous deeds those are the companions of paradise they will abide therein eternally
2|83|and recall when we took the covenant from the children of israel enjoining upon them do not worship except allah and to parents do good and to relatives orphans and the needy and speak to people good words and establish prayer and give zakah then you turned away except a few of you and you were refusing
2|84|and recall when we took your covenant saying do not shed each other s blood or evict one another from your homes then you acknowledged this while you were witnessing
2|85|then you are those same ones who are killing one another and evicting a party of your people from their homes cooperating against them in sin and aggression and if they come to you as captives you ransom them although their eviction was forbidden to you so do you believe in part of the scripture and disbelieve in part then what is the recompense for those who do that among you except disgrace in worldly life and on the day of resurrection they will be sent back to the severest of punishment and allah is not unaware of what you do
2|86|those are the ones who have bought the life of this world in exchange for the hereafter so the punishment will not be lightened for them nor will they be aided
2|87|and we did certainly give moses the torah and followed up after him with messengers and we gave jesus the son of mary clear proofs and supported him with the pure spirit but is it not that every time a messenger came to you o children of israel with what your souls did not desire you were arrogant and a party of messengers you denied and another party you killed
2|88|and they said our hearts are wrapped but in fact allah has cursed them for their disbelief so little is it that they believe
2|89|and when there came to them a book from allah confirming that which was with them although before they used to pray for victory against those who disbelieved but then when there came to them that which they recognized they disbelieved in it so the curse of allah will be upon the disbelievers
2|90|how wretched is that for which they sold themselves that they would disbelieve in what allah has revealed through their outrage that allah would send down his favor upon whom he wills from among his servants so they returned having earned wrath upon wrath and for the disbelievers is a humiliating punishment
2|91|and when it is said to them believe in what allah has revealed they say we believe only in what was revealed to us and they disbelieve in what came after it while it is the truth confirming that which is with them say then why did you kill the prophets of allah before if you are indeed believers
2|92|and moses had certainly brought you clear proofs then you took the calf in worship after that while you were wrongdoers
2|93|and recall when we took your covenant and raised over you the mount saying take what we have given you with determination and listen they said instead we hear and disobey and their hearts absorbed the worship of the calf because of their disbelief say how wretched is that which your faith enjoins upon you if you should be believers
2|94|say o muhammad if the home of the hereafter with allah is for you alone and not the other people then wish for death if you should be truthful
2|95|but they will never wish for it ever because of what their hands have put forth and allah is knowing of the wrongdoers
2|96|and you will surely find them the most greedy of people for life even more than those who associate others with allah one of them wishes that he could be granted life a thousand years but it would not remove him in the least from the coming punishment that he should be granted life and allah is seeing of what they do
2|97|say whoever is an enemy to gabriel it is none but he who has brought the qur an down upon your heart o muhammad by permission of allah confirming that which was before it and as guidance and good tidings for the believers
2|98|whoever is an enemy to allah and his angels and his messengers and gabriel and michael then indeed allah is an enemy to the disbelievers
2|99|and we have certainly revealed to you verses which are clear proofs and no one would deny them except the defiantly disobedient
2|100|is it not true that every time they took a covenant a party of them threw it away but in fact most of them do not believe
2|101|and when a messenger from allah came to them confirming that which was with them a party of those who had been given the scripture threw the scripture of allah behind their backs as if they did not know what it contained
2|102|and they followed instead what the devils had recited during the reign of solomon it was not solomon who disbelieved but the devils disbelieved teaching people magic and that which was revealed to the two angels at babylon harut and marut but the two angels do not teach anyone unless they say we are a trial so do not disbelieve by practicing magic and yet they learn from them that by which they cause separation between a man and his wife but they do not harm anyone through it except by permission of allah and the people learn what harms them and does not benefit them but the children of israel certainly knew that whoever purchased the magic would not have in the hereafter any share and wretched is that for which they sold themselves if they only knew
2|103|and if they had believed and feared allah then the reward from allah would have been far better if they only knew
2|104|o you who have believed say not to allah s messenger ra ina but say unthurna and listen and for the disbelievers is a painful punishment
2|105|neither those who disbelieve from the people of the scripture nor the polytheists wish that any good should be sent down to you from your lord but allah selects for his mercy whom he wills and allah is the possessor of great bounty
2|106|we do not abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten except that we bring forth one better than it or similar to it do you not know that allah is over all things competent
2|107|do you not know that to allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and that you have not besides allah any protector or any helper
2|108|or do you intend to ask your messenger as moses was asked before and whoever exchanges faith for disbelief has certainly strayed from the soundness of the way
2|109|many of the people of the scripture wish they could turn you back to disbelief after you have believed out of envy from themselves even after the truth has become clear to them so pardon and overlook until allah delivers his command indeed allah is over all things competent
2|110|and establish prayer and give zakah and whatever good you put forward for yourselves you will find it with allah indeed allah of what you do is seeing
2|111|and they say none will enter paradise except one who is a jew or a christian that is merely their wishful thinking say produce your proof if you should be truthful
2|112|yes on the contrary whoever submits his face in islam to allah while being a doer of good will have his reward with his lord and no fear will there be concerning them nor will they grieve
2|113|the jews say the christians have nothing true to stand on and the christians say the jews have nothing to stand on although they both recite the scripture thus the polytheists speak the same as their words but allah will judge between them on the day of resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ
2|114|and who are more unjust than those who prevent the name of allah from being mentioned in his mosques and strive toward their destruction it is not for them to enter them except in fear for them in this world is disgrace and they will have in the hereafter a great punishment
2|115|and to allah belongs the east and the west so wherever you might turn there is the face of allah indeed allah is all encompassing and knowing
2|116|they say allah has taken a son exalted is he rather to him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth all are devoutly obedient to him
2|117|originator of the heavens and the earth when he decrees a matter he only says to it be and it is
2|118|those who do not know say why does allah not speak to us or there come to us a sign thus spoke those before them like their words their hearts resemble each other we have shown clearly the signs to a people who are certain in faith
2|119|indeed we have sent you o muhammad with the truth as a bringer of good tidings and a warner and you will not be asked about the companions of hellfire
2|120|and never will the jews or the christians approve of you until you follow their religion say indeed the guidance of allah is the only guidance if you were to follow their desires after what has come to you of knowledge you would have against allah no protector or helper
2|121|those to whom we have given the book recite it with its true recital they are the ones who believe in it and whoever disbelieves in it it is they who are the losers
2|122|o children of israel remember my favor which i have bestowed upon you and that i preferred you over the worlds
2|123|and fear a day when no soul will suffice for another soul at all and no compensation will be accepted from it nor will any intercession benefit it nor will they be aided
2|124|and mention o muhammad when abraham was tried by his lord with commands and he fulfilled them allah said indeed i will make you a leader for the people abraham said and of my descendants allah said my covenant does not include the wrongdoers
2|125|and mention when we made the house a place of return for the people and a place of security and take o believers from the standing place of abraham a place of prayer and we charged abraham and ishmael saying purify my house for those who perform tawaf and those who are staying there for worship and those who bow and prostrate in prayer
2|126|and mention when abraham said my lord make this a secure city and provide its people with fruits whoever of them believes in allah and the last day allah said and whoever disbelieves i will grant him enjoyment for a little then i will force him to the punishment of the fire and wretched is the destination
2|127|and mention when abraham was raising the foundations of the house and with him ishmael saying our lord accept this from us indeed you are the hearing the knowing
2|128|our lord and make us muslims in submission to you and from our descendants a muslim nation in submission to you and show us our rites and accept our repentance indeed you are the accepting of repentance the merciful
2|129|our lord and send among them a messenger from themselves who will recite to them your verses and teach them the book and wisdom and purify them indeed you are the exalted in might the wise
2|130|and who would be averse to the religion of abraham except one who makes a fool of himself and we had chosen him in this world and indeed he in the hereafter will be among the righteous
2|131|when his lord said to him submit he said i have submitted in islam to the lord of the worlds
2|132|and abraham instructed his sons to do the same and so did jacob saying o my sons indeed allah has chosen for you this religion so do not die except while you are muslims
2|133|or were you witnesses when death approached jacob when he said to his sons what will you worship after me they said we will worship your god and the god of your fathers abraham and ishmael and isaac one god and we are muslims in submission to him
2|134|that was a nation which has passed on it will have the consequence of what it earned and you will have what you have earned and you will not be asked about what they used to do
2|135|they say be jews or christians so you will be guided say rather we follow the religion of abraham inclining toward truth and he was not of the polytheists
2|136|say o believers we have believed in allah and what has been revealed to us and what has been revealed to abraham and ishmael and isaac and jacob and the descendants and what was given to moses and jesus and what was given to the prophets from their lord we make no distinction between any of them and we are muslims in submission to him
2|137|so if they believe in the same as you believe in then they have been rightly guided but if they turn away they are only in dissension and allah will be sufficient for you against them and he is the hearing the knowing
2|138|and say ours is the religion of allah and who is better than allah in ordaining religion and we are worshippers of him
2|139|say o muhammad do you argue with us about allah while he is our lord and your lord for us are our deeds and for you are your deeds and we are sincere in deed and intention to him
2|140|or do you say that abraham and ishmael and isaac and jacob and the descendants were jews or christians say are you more knowing or is allah and who is more unjust than one who conceals a testimony he has from allah and allah is not unaware of what you do
2|141|that is a nation which has passed on it will have the consequence of what it earned and you will have what you have earned and you will not be asked about what they used to do
2|142|the foolish among the people will say what has turned them away from their qiblah which they used to face say to allah belongs the east and the west he guides whom he wills to a straight path
2|143|and thus we have made you a just community that you will be witnesses over the people and the messenger will be a witness over you and we did not make the qiblah which you used to face except that we might make evident who would follow the messenger from who would turn back on his heels and indeed it is difficult except for those whom allah has guided and never would allah have caused you to lose your faith indeed allah is to the people kind and merciful
2|144|we have certainly seen the turning of your face o muhammad toward the heaven and we will surely turn you to a qiblah with which you will be pleased so turn your face toward al masjid al haram and wherever you believers are turn your faces toward it in prayer indeed those who have been given the scripture well know that it is the truth from their lord and allah is not unaware of what they do
2|145|and if you brought to those who were given the scripture every sign they would not follow your qiblah nor will you be a follower of their qiblah nor would they be followers of one another s qiblah so if you were to follow their desires after what has come to you of knowledge indeed you would then be among the wrongdoers
2|146|those to whom we gave the scripture know him as they know their own sons but indeed a party of them conceal the truth while they know it
2|147|the truth is from your lord so never be among the doubters
2|148|for each religious following is a direction toward which it faces so race to all that is good wherever you may be allah will bring you forth for judgement all together indeed allah is over all things competent
2|149|so from wherever you go out for prayer o muhammad turn your face toward al masjid al haram and indeed it is the truth from your lord and allah is not unaware of what you do
2|150|and from wherever you go out for prayer turn your face toward al masjid al haram and wherever you believers may be turn your faces toward it in order that the people will not have any argument against you except for those of them who commit wrong so fear them not but fear me and it is so i may complete my favor upon you and that you may be guided
2|151|just as we have sent among you a messenger from yourselves reciting to you our verses and purifying you and teaching you the book and wisdom and teaching you that which you did not know
2|152|so remember me i will remember you and be grateful to me and do not deny me
2|153|o you who have believed seek help through patience and prayer indeed allah is with the patient
2|154|and do not say about those who are killed in the way of allah they are dead rather they are alive but you perceive it not
2|155|and we will surely test you with something of fear and hunger and a loss of wealth and lives and fruits but give good tidings to the patient
2|156|who when disaster strikes them say indeed we belong to allah and indeed to him we will return
2|157|those are the ones upon whom are blessings from their lord and mercy and it is those who are the rightly guided
2|158|indeed as safa and al marwah are among the symbols of allah so whoever makes hajj to the house or performs umrah there is no blame upon him for walking between them and whoever volunteers good then indeed allah is appreciative and knowing
2|159|indeed those who conceal what we sent down of clear proofs and guidance after we made it clear for the people in the scripture those are cursed by allah and cursed by those who curse
2|160|except for those who repent and correct themselves and make evident what they concealed those i will accept their repentance and i am the accepting of repentance the merciful
2|161|indeed those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers upon them will be the curse of allah and of the angels and the people all together
2|162|abiding eternally therein the punishment will not be lightened for them nor will they be reprieved
2|163|and your god is one god there is no deity worthy of worship except him the entirely merciful the especially merciful
2|164|indeed in the creation of the heavens and earth and the alternation of the night and the day and the great ships which sail through the sea with that which benefits people and what allah has sent down from the heavens of rain giving life thereby to the earth after its lifelessness and dispersing therein every kind of moving creature and his directing of the winds and the clouds controlled between the heaven and the earth are signs for a people who use reason
2|165|and yet among the people are those who take other than allah as equals to him they love them as they should love allah but those who believe are stronger in love for allah and if only they who have wronged would consider that when they see the punishment they will be certain that all power belongs to allah and that allah is severe in punishment
2|166|and they should consider that when those who have been followed disassociate themselves from those who followed them and they all see the punishment and cut off from them are the ties of relationship
2|167|those who followed will say if only we had another turn at worldly life so we could disassociate ourselves from them as they have disassociated themselves from us thus will allah show them their deeds as regrets upon them and they are never to emerge from the fire
2|168|o mankind eat from whatever is on earth that is lawful and good and do not follow the footsteps of satan indeed he is to you a clear enemy
2|169|he only orders you to evil and immorality and to say about allah what you do not know
2|170|and when it is said to them follow what allah has revealed they say rather we will follow that which we found our fathers doing even though their fathers understood nothing nor were they guided
2|171|the example of those who disbelieve is like that of one who shouts at what hears nothing but calls and cries cattle or sheep deaf dumb and blind so they do not understand
2|172|o you who have believed eat from the good things which we have provided for you and be grateful to allah if it is indeed him that you worship
2|173|he has only forbidden to you dead animals blood the flesh of swine and that which has been dedicated to other than allah but whoever is forced by necessity neither desiring it nor transgressing its limit there is no sin upon him indeed allah is forgiving and merciful
2|174|indeed they who conceal what allah has sent down of the book and exchange it for a small price those consume not into their bellies except the fire and allah will not speak to them on the day of resurrection nor will he purify them and they will have a painful punishment
2|175|those are the ones who have exchanged guidance for error and forgiveness for punishment how patient they are in pursuit of the fire
2|176|that is deserved by them because allah has sent down the book in truth and indeed those who differ over the book are in extreme dissension
2|177|righteousness is not that you turn your faces toward the east or the west but true righteousness is in one who believes in allah the last day the angels the book and the prophets and gives wealth in spite of love for it to relatives orphans the needy the traveler those who ask for help and for freeing slaves and who establishes prayer and gives zakah those who fulfill their promise when they promise and those who are patient in poverty and hardship and during battle those are the ones who have been true and it is those who are the righteous
2|178|o you who have believed prescribed for you is legal retribution for those murdered the free for the free the slave for the slave and the female for the female but whoever overlooks from his brother anything then there should be a suitable follow up and payment to him with good conduct this is an alleviation from your lord and a mercy but whoever transgresses after that will have a painful punishment
2|179|and there is for you in legal retribution saving of life o you people of understanding that you may become righteous
2|180|prescribed for you when death approaches any one of you if he leaves wealth is that he should make a bequest for the parents and near relatives according to what is acceptable a duty upon the righteous
2|181|then whoever alters the bequest after he has heard it the sin is only upon those who have altered it indeed allah is hearing and knowing
2|182|but if one fears from the bequeather some error or sin and corrects that which is between them there is no sin upon him indeed allah is forgiving and merciful
2|183|o you who have believed decreed upon you is fasting as it was decreed upon those before you that you may become righteous
2|184|fasting for a limited number of days so whoever among you is ill or on a journey during them then an equal number of days are to be made up and upon those who are able to fast but with hardship a ransom as substitute of feeding a poor person each day and whoever volunteers excess it is better for him but to fast is best for you if you only knew
2|185|the month of ramadhan is that in which was revealed the qur an a guidance for the people and clear proofs of guidance and criterion so whoever sights the new moon of the month let him fast it and whoever is ill or on a journey then an equal number of other days allah intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship and wants for you to complete the period and to glorify allah for that to which he has guided you and perhaps you will be grateful
2|186|and when my servants ask you o muhammad concerning me indeed i am near i respond to the invocation of the supplicant when he calls upon me so let them respond to me by obedience and believe in me that they may be rightly guided
2|187|it has been made permissible for you the night preceding fasting to go to your wives for sexual relations they are clothing for you and you are clothing for them allah knows that you used to deceive yourselves so he accepted your repentance and forgave you so now have relations with them and seek that which allah has decreed for you and eat and drink until the white thread of dawn becomes distinct to you from the black thread of night then complete the fast until the sunset and do not have relations with them as long as you are staying for worship in the mosques these are the limits set by allah so do not approach them thus does allah make clear his ordinances to the people that they may become righteous
2|188|and do not consume one another s wealth unjustly or send it in bribery to the rulers in order that they might aid you to consume a portion of the wealth of the people in sin while you know it is unlawful
2|189|they ask you o muhammad about the new moons say they are measurements of time for the people and for hajj and it is not righteousness to enter houses from the back but righteousness is in one who fears allah and enter houses from their doors and fear allah that you may succeed
2|190|fight in the way of allah those who fight you but do not transgress indeed allah does not like transgressors
2|191|and kill them wherever you overtake them and expel them from wherever they have expelled you and fitnah is worse than killing and do not fight them at al masjid al haram until they fight you there but if they fight you then kill them such is the recompense of the disbelievers
2|192|and if they cease then indeed allah is forgiving and merciful
2|193|fight them until there is no more fitnah and until worship is acknowledged to be for allah but if they cease then there is to be no aggression except against the oppressors
2|194|fighting in the sacred month is for aggression committed in the sacred month and for all violations is legal retribution so whoever has assaulted you then assault him in the same way that he has assaulted you and fear allah and know that allah is with those who fear him
2|195|and spend in the way of allah and do not throw yourselves with your own hands into destruction by refraining and do good indeed allah loves the doers of good
2|196|and complete the hajj and umrah for allah but if you are prevented then offer what can be obtained with ease of sacrificial animals and do not shave your heads until the sacrificial animal has reached its place of slaughter and whoever among you is ill or has an ailment of the head making shaving necessary must offer a ransom of fasting three days or charity or sacrifice and when you are secure then whoever performs umrah during the hajj months followed by hajj offers what can be obtained with ease of sacrificial animals and whoever cannot find or afford such an animal then a fast of three days during hajj and of seven when you have returned home those are ten complete days this is for those whose family is not in the area of al masjid al haram and fear allah and know that allah is severe in penalty
2|197|hajj is during well known months so whoever has made hajj obligatory upon himself therein by entering the state of ihram there is to be for him no sexual relations and no disobedience and no disputing during hajj and whatever good you do allah knows it and take provisions but indeed the best provision is fear of allah and fear me o you of understanding
2|198|there is no blame upon you for seeking bounty from your lord during hajj but when you depart from arafat remember allah at al mash ar al haram and remember him as he has guided you for indeed you were before that among those astray
2|199|then depart from the place from where all the people depart and ask forgiveness of allah indeed allah is forgiving and merciful
2|200|and when you have completed your rites remember allah like your previous remembrance of your fathers or with much greater remembrance and among the people is he who says our lord give us in this world and he will have in the hereafter no share
2|201|but among them is he who says our lord give us in this world that which is good and in the hereafter that which is good and protect us from the punishment of the fire
2|202|those will have a share of what they have earned and allah is swift in account
2|203|and remember allah during specific numbered days then whoever hastens his departure in two days there is no sin upon him and whoever delays until the third there is no sin upon him for him who fears allah and fear allah and know that unto him you will be gathered
2|204|and of the people is he whose speech pleases you in worldly life and he calls allah to witness as to what is in his heart yet he is the fiercest of opponents
2|205|and when he goes away he strives throughout the land to cause corruption therein and destroy crops and animals and allah does not like corruption
2|206|and when it is said to him fear allah pride in the sin takes hold of him sufficient for him is hellfire and how wretched is the resting place
2|207|and of the people is he who sells himself seeking means to the approval of allah and allah is kind to his servants
2|208|o you who have believed enter into islam completely and perfectly and do not follow the footsteps of satan indeed he is to you a clear enemy
2|209|but if you deviate after clear proofs have come to you then know that allah is exalted in might and wise
2|210|do they await but that allah should come to them in covers of clouds and the angels as well and the matter is then decided and to allah all matters are returned
2|211|ask the children of israel how many a sign of evidence we have given them and whoever exchanges the favor of allah for disbelief after it has come to him then indeed allah is severe in penalty
2|212|beautified for those who disbelieve is the life of this world and they ridicule those who believe but those who fear allah are above them on the day of resurrection and allah gives provision to whom he wills without account
2|213|mankind was of one religion before their deviation then allah sent the prophets as bringers of good tidings and warners and sent down with them the scripture in truth to judge between the people concerning that in which they differed and none differed over the scripture except those who were given it after the clear proofs came to them out of jealous animosity among themselves and allah guided those who believed to the truth concerning that over which they had differed by his permission and allah guides whom he wills to a straight path
2|214|or do you think that you will enter paradise while such trial has not yet come to you as came to those who passed on before you they were touched by poverty and hardship and were shaken until even their messenger and those who believed with him said when is the help of allah unquestionably the help of allah is near
2|215|they ask you o muhammad what they should spend say whatever you spend of good is to be for parents and relatives and orphans and the needy and the traveler and whatever you do of good indeed allah is knowing of it
2|216|fighting has been enjoined upon you while it is hateful to you but perhaps you hate a thing and it is good for you and perhaps you love a thing and it is bad for you and allah knows while you know not
2|217|they ask you about the sacred month about fighting therein say fighting therein is great sin but averting people from the way of allah and disbelief in him and preventing access to al masjid al haram and the expulsion of its people therefrom are greater evil in the sight of allah and fitnah is greater than killing and they will continue to fight you until they turn you back from your religion if they are able and whoever of you reverts from his religion to disbelief and dies while he is a disbeliever for those their deeds have become worthless in this world and the hereafter and those are the companions of the fire they will abide therein eternally
2|218|indeed those who have believed and those who have emigrated and fought in the cause of allah those expect the mercy of allah and allah is forgiving and merciful
2|219|they ask you about wine and gambling say in them is great sin and yet some benefit for people but their sin is greater than their benefit and they ask you what they should spend say the excess beyond needs thus allah makes clear to you the verses of revelation that you might give thought
2|220|to this world and the hereafter and they ask you about orphans say improvement for them is best and if you mix your affairs with theirs they are your brothers and allah knows the corrupter from the amender and if allah had willed he could have put you in difficulty indeed allah is exalted in might and wise
2|221|and do not marry polytheistic women until they believe and a believing slave woman is better than a polytheist even though she might please you and do not marry polytheistic men to your women until they believe and a believing slave is better than a polytheist even though he might please you those invite you to the fire but allah invites to paradise and to forgiveness by his permission and he makes clear his verses to the people that perhaps they may remember
2|222|and they ask you about menstruation say it is harm so keep away from wives during menstruation and do not approach them until they are pure and when they have purified themselves then come to them from where allah has ordained for you indeed allah loves those who are constantly repentant and loves those who purify themselves
2|223|your wives are a place of sowing of seed for you so come to your place of cultivation however you wish and put forth righteousness for yourselves and fear allah and know that you will meet him and give good tidings to the believers
2|224|and do not make your oath by allah an excuse against being righteous and fearing allah and making peace among people and allah is hearing and knowing
2|225|allah does not impose blame upon you for what is unintentional in your oaths but he imposes blame upon you for what your hearts have earned and allah is forgiving and forbearing
2|226|for those who swear not to have sexual relations with their wives is a waiting time of four months but if they return to normal relations then indeed allah is forgiving and merciful
2|227|and if they decide on divorce then indeed allah is hearing and knowing
2|228|divorced women remain in waiting for three periods and it is not lawful for them to conceal what allah has created in their wombs if they believe in allah and the last day and their husbands have more right to take them back in this period if they want reconciliation and due to the wives is similar to what is expected of them according to what is reasonable but the men have a degree over them in responsibility and authority and allah is exalted in might and wise
2|229|divorce is twice then either keep her in an acceptable manner or release her with good treatment and it is not lawful for you to take anything of what you have given them unless both fear that they will not be able to keep within the limits of allah but if you fear that they will not keep within the limits of allah then there is no blame upon either of them concerning that by which she ransoms herself these are the limits of allah so do not transgress them and whoever transgresses the limits of allah it is those who are the wrongdoers
2|230|and if he has divorced her for the third time then she is not lawful to him afterward until after she marries a husband other than him and if the latter husband divorces her or dies there is no blame upon the woman and her former husband for returning to each other if they think that they can keep within the limits of allah these are the limits of allah which he makes clear to a people who know
2|231|and when you divorce women and they have nearly fulfilled their term either retain them according to acceptable terms or release them according to acceptable terms and do not keep them intending harm to transgress against them and whoever does that has certainly wronged himself and do not take the verses of allah in jest and remember the favor of allah upon you and what has been revealed to you of the book and wisdom by which he instructs you and fear allah and know that allah is knowing of all things
2|232|and when you divorce women and they have fulfilled their term do not prevent them from remarrying their former husbands if they agree among themselves on an acceptable basis that is instructed to whoever of you believes in allah and the last day that is better for you and purer and allah knows and you know not
2|233|mothers may breastfeed their children two complete years for whoever wishes to complete the nursing period upon the father is the mothers provision and their clothing according to what is acceptable no person is charged with more than his capacity no mother should be harmed through her child and no father through his child and upon the father s heir is a duty like that of the father and if they both desire weaning through mutual consent from both of them and consultation there is no blame upon either of them and if you wish to have your children nursed by a substitute there is no blame upon you as long as you give payment according to what is acceptable and fear allah and know that allah is seeing of what you do
2|234|and those who are taken in death among you and leave wives behind they the wives shall wait four months and ten days and when they have fulfilled their term then there is no blame upon you for what they do with themselves in an acceptable manner and allah is fully acquainted with what you do
2|235|there is no blame upon you for that to which you indirectly allude concerning a proposal to women or for what you conceal within yourselves allah knows that you will have them in mind but do not promise them secretly except for saying a proper saying and do not determine to undertake a marriage contract until the decreed period reaches its end and know that allah knows what is within yourselves so beware of him and know that allah is forgiving and forbearing
2|236|there is no blame upon you if you divorce women you have not touched nor specified for them an obligation but give them a gift of compensation the wealthy according to his capability and the poor according to his capability a provision according to what is acceptable a duty upon the doers of good
2|237|and if you divorce them before you have touched them and you have already specified for them an obligation then give half of what you specified unless they forego the right or the one in whose hand is the marriage contract foregoes it and to forego it is nearer to righteousness and do not forget graciousness between you indeed allah of whatever you do is seeing
2|238|maintain with care the obligatory prayers and in particular the middle prayer and stand before allah devoutly obedient
2|239|and if you fear an enemy then pray on foot or riding but when you are secure then remember allah in prayer as he has taught you that which you did not previously know
2|240|and those who are taken in death among you and leave wives behind for their wives is a bequest maintenance for one year without turning them out but if they leave of their own accord then there is no blame upon you for what they do with themselves in an acceptable way and allah is exalted in might and wise
2|241|and for divorced women is a provision according to what is acceptable a duty upon the righteous
2|242|thus does allah make clear to you his verses that you might use reason
2|243|have you not considered those who left their homes in many thousands fearing death allah said to them die then he restored them to life and allah is full of bounty to the people but most of the people do not show gratitude
2|244|and fight in the cause of allah and know that allah is hearing and knowing
2|245|who is it that would loan allah a goodly loan so he may multiply it for him many times over and it is allah who withholds and grants abundance and to him you will be returned
2|246|have you not considered the assembly of the children of israel after the time of moses when they said to a prophet of theirs send to us a king and we will fight in the way of allah he said would you perhaps refrain from fighting if fighting was prescribed for you they said and why should we not fight in the cause of allah when we have been driven out from our homes and from our children but when fighting was prescribed for them they turned away except for a few of them and allah is knowing of the wrongdoers
2|247|and their prophet said to them indeed allah has sent to you saul as a king they said how can he have kingship over us while we are more worthy of kingship than him and he has not been given any measure of wealth he said indeed allah has chosen him over you and has increased him abundantly in knowledge and stature and allah gives his sovereignty to whom he wills and allah is all encompassing in favor and knowing
2|248|and their prophet said to them indeed a sign of his kingship is that the chest will come to you in which is assurance from your lord and a remnant of what the family of moses and the family of aaron had left carried by the angels indeed in that is a sign for you if you are believers
2|249|and when saul went forth with the soldiers he said indeed allah will be testing you with a river so whoever drinks from it is not of me and whoever does not taste it is indeed of me excepting one who takes from it in the hollow of his hand but they drank from it except a very few of them then when he had crossed it along with those who believed with him they said there is no power for us today against goliath and his soldiers but those who were certain that they would meet allah said how many a small company has overcome a large company by permission of allah and allah is with the patient
2|250|and when they went forth to face goliath and his soldiers they said our lord pour upon us patience and plant firmly our feet and give us victory over the disbelieving people
2|251|so they defeated them by permission of allah and david killed goliath and allah gave him the kingship and prophethood and taught him from that which he willed and if it were not for allah checking some people by means of others the earth would have been corrupted but allah is full of bounty to the worlds
2|252|these are the verses of allah which we recite to you o muhammad in truth and indeed you are from among the messengers
2|253|those messengers some of them we caused to exceed others among them were those to whom allah spoke and he raised some of them in degree and we gave jesus the son of mary clear proofs and we supported him with the pure spirit if allah had willed those generations succeeding them would not have fought each other after the clear proofs had come to them but they differed and some of them believed and some of them disbelieved and if allah had willed they would not have fought each other but allah does what he intends
2|254|o you who have believed spend from that which we have provided for you before there comes a day in which there is no exchange and no friendship and no intercession and the disbelievers they are the wrongdoers
2|255|allah there is no deity except him the ever living the sustainer of all existence neither drowsiness overtakes him nor sleep to him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth who is it that can intercede with him except by his permission he knows what is presently before them and what will be after them and they encompass not a thing of his knowledge except for what he wills his kursi extends over the heavens and the earth and their preservation tires him not and he is the most high the most great
2|256|there shall be no compulsion in acceptance of the religion the right course has become clear from the wrong so whoever disbelieves in taghut and believes in allah has grasped the most trustworthy handhold with no break in it and allah is hearing and knowing
2|257|allah is the ally of those who believe he brings them out from darknesses into the light and those who disbelieve their allies are taghut they take them out of the light into darknesses those are the companions of the fire they will abide eternally therein
2|258|have you not considered the one who argued with abraham about his lord merely because allah had given him kingship when abraham said my lord is the one who gives life and causes death he said i give life and cause death abraham said indeed allah brings up the sun from the east so bring it up from the west so the disbeliever was overwhelmed by astonishment and allah does not guide the wrongdoing people
2|259|or consider such an example as the one who passed by a township which had fallen into ruin he said how will allah bring this to life after its death so allah caused him to die for a hundred years then he revived him he said how long have you remained the man said i have remained a day or part of a day he said rather you have remained one hundred years look at your food and your drink it has not changed with time and look at your donkey and we will make you a sign for the people and look at the bones of this donkey how we raise them and then we cover them with flesh and when it became clear to him he said i know that allah is over all things competent
2|260|and mention when abraham said my lord show me how you give life to the dead allah said have you not believed he said yes but i ask only that my heart may be satisfied allah said take four birds and commit them to yourself then after slaughtering them put on each hill a portion of them then call them they will come flying to you in haste and know that allah is exalted in might and wise
2|261|the example of those who spend their wealth in the way of allah is like a seed of grain which grows seven spikes in each spike is a hundred grains and allah multiplies his reward for whom he wills and allah is all encompassing and knowing
2|262|those who spend their wealth in the way of allah and then do not follow up what they have spent with reminders of it or other injury will have their reward with their lord and there will be no fear concerning them nor will they grieve
2|263|kind speech and forgiveness are better than charity followed by injury and allah is free of need and forbearing
2|264|o you who have believed do not invalidate your charities with reminders or injury as does one who spends his wealth only to be seen by the people and does not believe in allah and the last day his example is like that of a large smooth stone upon which is dust and is hit by a downpour that leaves it bare they are unable to keep anything of what they have earned and allah does not guide the disbelieving people
2|265|and the example of those who spend their wealth seeking means to the approval of allah and assuring reward for themselves is like a garden on high ground which is hit by a downpour so it yields its fruits in double and even if it is not hit by a downpour then a drizzle is sufficient and allah of what you do is seeing
2|266|would one of you like to have a garden of palm trees and grapevines underneath which rivers flow in which he has from every fruit but he is afflicted with old age and has weak offspring and it is hit by a whirlwind containing fire and is burned thus does allah make clear to you his verses that you might give thought
2|267|o you who have believed spend from the good things which you have earned and from that which we have produced for you from the earth and do not aim toward the defective therefrom spending from that while you would not take it yourself except with closed eyes and know that allah is free of need and praiseworthy
2|268|satan threatens you with poverty and orders you to immorality while allah promises you forgiveness from him and bounty and allah is all encompassing and knowing
2|269|he gives wisdom to whom he wills and whoever has been given wisdom has certainly been given much good and none will remember except those of understanding
2|270|and whatever you spend of expenditures or make of vows indeed allah knows of it and for the wrongdoers there are no helpers
2|271|if you disclose your charitable expenditures they are good but if you conceal them and give them to the poor it is better for you and he will remove from you some of your misdeeds thereby and allah with what you do is fully acquainted
2|272|not upon you o muhammad is responsibility for their guidance but allah guides whom he wills and whatever good you believers spend is for yourselves and you do not spend except seeking the countenance of allah and whatever you spend of good it will be fully repaid to you and you will not be wronged
2|273|charity is for the poor who have been restricted for the cause of allah unable to move about in the land an ignorant person would think them self sufficient because of their restraint but you will know them by their characteristic sign they do not ask people persistently or at all and whatever you spend of good indeed allah is knowing of it
2|274|those who spend their wealth in allah s way by night and by day secretly and publicly they will have their reward with their lord and no fear will there be concerning them nor will they grieve
2|275|those who consume interest cannot stand on the day of resurrection except as one stands who is being beaten by satan into insanity that is because they say trade is just like interest but allah has permitted trade and has forbidden interest so whoever has received an admonition from his lord and desists may have what is past and his affair rests with allah but whoever returns to dealing in interest or usury those are the companions of the fire they will abide eternally therein
2|276|allah destroys interest and gives increase for charities and allah does not like every sinning disbeliever
2|277|indeed those who believe and do righteous deeds and establish prayer and give zakah will have their reward with their lord and there will be no fear concerning them nor will they grieve
2|278|o you who have believed fear allah and give up what remains due to you of interest if you should be believers
2|279|and if you do not then be informed of a war against you from allah and his messenger but if you repent you may have your principal thus you do no wrong nor are you wronged
2|280|and if someone is in hardship then let there be postponement until a time of ease but if you give from your right as charity then it is better for you if you only knew
2|281|and fear a day when you will be returned to allah then every soul will be compensated for what it earned and they will not be treated unjustly
2|282|o you who have believed when you contract a debt for a specified term write it down and let a scribe write it between you in justice let no scribe refuse to write as allah has taught him so let him write and let the one who has the obligation dictate and let him fear allah his lord and not leave anything out of it but if the one who has the obligation is of limited understanding or weak or unable to dictate himself then let his guardian dictate in justice and bring to witness two witnesses from among your men and if there are not two men available then a man and two women from those whom you accept as witnesses so that if one of the women errs then the other can remind her and let not the witnesses refuse when they are called upon and do not be too weary to write it whether it is small or large for its specified term that is more just in the sight of allah and stronger as evidence and more likely to prevent doubt between you except when it is an immediate transaction which you conduct among yourselves for then there is no blame upon you if you do not write it and take witnesses when you conclude a contract let no scribe be harmed or any witness for if you do so indeed it is grave disobedience in you and fear allah and allah teaches you and allah is knowing of all things
2|283|and if you are on a journey and cannot find a scribe then a security deposit should be taken and if one of you entrusts another then let him who is entrusted discharge his trust faithfully and let him fear allah his lord and do not conceal testimony for whoever conceals it his heart is indeed sinful and allah is knowing of what you do
2|284|to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth whether you show what is within yourselves or conceal it allah will bring you to account for it then he will forgive whom he wills and punish whom he wills and allah is over all things competent
2|285|the messenger has believed in what was revealed to him from his lord and so have the believers all of them have believed in allah and his angels and his books and his messengers saying we make no distinction between any of his messengers and they say we hear and we obey we seek your forgiveness our lord and to you is the final destination
2|286|allah does not charge a soul except with that within its capacity it will have the consequence of what good it has gained and it will bear the consequence of what evil it has earned our lord do not impose blame upon us if we have forgotten or erred our lord and lay not upon us a burden like that which you laid upon those before us our lord and burden us not with that which we have no ability to bear and pardon us and forgive us and have mercy upon us you are our protector so give us victory over the disbelieving people
3|1|alif lam meem
3|2|allah there is no deity except him the ever living the sustainer of existence
3|3|he has sent down upon you o muhammad the book in truth confirming what was before it and he revealed the torah and the gospel
3|4|before as guidance for the people and he revealed the qur an indeed those who disbelieve in the verses of allah will have a severe punishment and allah is exalted in might the owner of retribution
3|5|indeed from allah nothing is hidden in the earth nor in the heaven
3|6|it is he who forms you in the wombs however he wills there is no deity except him the exalted in might the wise
3|7|it is he who has sent down to you o muhammad the book in it are verses that are precise they are the foundation of the book and others unspecific as for those in whose hearts is deviation from truth they will follow that of it which is unspecific seeking discord and seeking an interpretation suitable to them and no one knows its true interpretation except allah but those firm in knowledge say we believe in it all of it is from our lord and no one will be reminded except those of understanding
3|8|who say our lord let not our hearts deviate after you have guided us and grant us from yourself mercy indeed you are the bestower
3|9|our lord surely you will gather the people for a day about which there is no doubt indeed allah does not fail in his promise
3|10|indeed those who disbelieve never will their wealth or their children avail them against allah at all and it is they who are fuel for the fire
3|11|theirs is like the custom of the people of pharaoh and those before them they denied our signs so allah seized them for their sins and allah is severe in penalty
3|12|say to those who disbelieve you will be overcome and gathered together to hell and wretched is the resting place
3|13|already there has been for you a sign in the two armies which met one fighting in the cause of allah and another of disbelievers they saw them to be twice their own number by their eyesight but allah supports with his victory whom he wills indeed in that is a lesson for those of vision
3|14|beautified for people is the love of that which they desire of women and sons heaped up sums of gold and silver fine branded horses and cattle and tilled land that is the enjoyment of worldly life but allah has with him the best return
3|15|say shall i inform you of something better than that for those who fear allah will be gardens in the presence of their lord beneath which rivers flow wherein they abide eternally and purified spouses and approval from allah and allah is seeing of his servants
3|16|those who say our lord indeed we have believed so forgive us our sins and protect us from the punishment of the fire
3|17|the patient the true the obedient those who spend in the way of allah and those who seek forgiveness before dawn
3|18|allah witnesses that there is no deity except him and so do the angels and those of knowledge that he is maintaining creation in justice there is no deity except him the exalted in might the wise
3|19|indeed the religion in the sight of allah is islam and those who were given the scripture did not differ except after knowledge had come to them out of jealous animosity between themselves and whoever disbelieves in the verses of allah then indeed allah is swift in taking account
3|20|so if they argue with you say i have submitted myself to allah in islam and so have those who follow me and say to those who were given the scripture and to the unlearned have you submitted yourselves and if they submit in islam they are rightly guided but if they turn away then upon you is only the duty of notification and allah is seeing of his servants
3|21|those who disbelieve in the signs of allah and kill the prophets without right and kill those who order justice from among the people give them tidings of a painful punishment
3|22|they are the ones whose deeds have become worthless in this world and the hereafter and for them there will be no helpers
3|23|do you not consider o muhammad those who were given a portion of the scripture they are invited to the scripture of allah that it should arbitrate between them then a party of them turns away and they are refusing
3|24|that is because they say never will the fire touch us except for a few numbered days and because they were deluded in their religion by what they were inventing
3|25|so how will it be when we assemble them for a day about which there is no doubt and each soul will be compensated in full for what it earned and they will not be wronged
3|26|say o allah owner of sovereignty you give sovereignty to whom you will and you take sovereignty away from whom you will you honor whom you will and you humble whom you will in your hand is all good indeed you are over all things competent
3|27|you cause the night to enter the day and you cause the day to enter the night and you bring the living out of the dead and you bring the dead out of the living and you give provision to whom you will without account
3|28|let not believers take disbelievers as allies rather than believers and whoever of you does that has nothing with allah except when taking precaution against them in prudence and allah warns you of himself and to allah is the final destination
3|29|say whether you conceal what is in your breasts or reveal it allah knows it and he knows that which is in the heavens and that which is on the earth and allah is over all things competent
3|30|the day every soul will find what it has done of good present before it and what it has done of evil it will wish that between itself and that evil was a great distance and allah warns you of himself and allah is kind to his servants
3|31|say o muhammad if you should love allah then follow me so allah will love you and forgive you your sins and allah is forgiving and merciful
3|32|say obey allah and the messenger but if they turn away then indeed allah does not like the disbelievers
3|33|indeed allah chose adam and noah and the family of abraham and the family of imran over the worlds
3|34|descendants some of them from others and allah is hearing and knowing
3|35|mention o muhammad when the wife of imran said my lord indeed i have pledged to you what is in my womb consecrated for your service so accept this from me indeed you are the hearing the knowing
3|36|but when she delivered her she said my lord i have delivered a female and allah was most knowing of what she delivered and the male is not like the female and i have named her mary and i seek refuge for her in you and for her descendants from satan the expelled from the mercy of allah
3|37|so her lord accepted her with good acceptance and caused her to grow in a good manner and put her in the care of zechariah every time zechariah entered upon her in the prayer chamber he found with her provision he said o mary from where is this coming to you she said it is from allah indeed allah provides for whom he wills without account
3|38|at that zechariah called upon his lord saying my lord grant me from yourself a good offspring indeed you are the hearer of supplication
3|39|so the angels called him while he was standing in prayer in the chamber indeed allah gives you good tidings of john confirming a word from allah and who will be honorable abstaining from women and a prophet from among the righteous
3|40|he said my lord how will i have a boy when i have reached old age and my wife is barren the angel said such is allah he does what he wills
3|41|he said my lord make for me a sign he said your sign is that you will not be able to speak to the people for three days except by gesture and remember your lord much and exalt him with praise in the evening and the morning
3|42|and mention when the angels said o mary indeed allah has chosen you and purified you and chosen you above the women of the worlds
3|43|o mary be devoutly obedient to your lord and prostrate and bow with those who bow in prayer
3|44|that is from the news of the unseen which we reveal to you o muhammad and you were not with them when they cast their pens as to which of them should be responsible for mary nor were you with them when they disputed
3|45|and mention when the angels said o mary indeed allah gives you good tidings of a word from him whose name will be the messiah jesus the son of mary distinguished in this world and the hereafter and among those brought near to allah
3|46|he will speak to the people in the cradle and in maturity and will be of the righteous
3|47|she said my lord how will i have a child when no man has touched me the angel said such is allah he creates what he wills when he decrees a matter he only says to it be and it is
3|48|and he will teach him writing and wisdom and the torah and the gospel
3|49|and make him a messenger to the children of israel who will say indeed i have come to you with a sign from your lord in that i design for you from clay that which is like the form of a bird then i breathe into it and it becomes a bird by permission of allah and i cure the blind and the leper and i give life to the dead by permission of allah and i inform you of what you eat and what you store in your houses indeed in that is a sign for you if you are believers
3|50|and i have come confirming what was before me of the torah and to make lawful for you some of what was forbidden to you and i have come to you with a sign from your lord so fear allah and obey me
3|51|indeed allah is my lord and your lord so worship him that is the straight path
3|52|but when jesus felt persistence in disbelief from them he said who are my supporters for the cause of allah the disciples said we are supporters for allah we have believed in allah and testify that we are muslims submitting to him
3|53|our lord we have believed in what you revealed and have followed the messenger jesus so register us among the witnesses to truth
3|54|and the disbelievers planned but allah planned and allah is the best of planners
3|55|mention when allah said o jesus indeed i will take you and raise you to myself and purify you from those who disbelieve and make those who follow you in submission to allah alone superior to those who disbelieve until the day of resurrection then to me is your return and i will judge between you concerning that in which you used to differ
3|56|and as for those who disbelieved i will punish them with a severe punishment in this world and the hereafter and they will have no helpers
3|57|but as for those who believed and did righteous deeds he will give them in full their rewards and allah does not like the wrongdoers
3|58|this is what we recite to you o muhammad of our verses and the precise and wise message
3|59|indeed the example of jesus to allah is like that of adam he created him from dust then he said to him be and he was
3|60|the truth is from your lord so do not be among the doubters
3|61|then whoever argues with you about it after this knowledge has come to you say come let us call our sons and your sons our women and your women ourselves and yourselves then supplicate earnestly together and invoke the curse of allah upon the liars among us
3|62|indeed this is the true narration and there is no deity except allah and indeed allah is the exalted in might the wise
3|63|but if they turn away then indeed allah is knowing of the corrupters
3|64|say o people of the scripture come to a word that is equitable between us and you that we will not worship except allah and not associate anything with him and not take one another as lords instead of allah but if they turn away then say bear witness that we are muslims submitting to him
3|65|o people of the scripture why do you argue about abraham while the torah and the gospel were not revealed until after him then will you not reason
3|66|here you are those who have argued about that of which you have some knowledge but why do you argue about that of which you have no knowledge and allah knows while you know not
3|67|abraham was neither a jew nor a christian but he was one inclining toward truth a muslim submitting to allah and he was not of the polytheists
3|68|indeed the most worthy of abraham among the people are those who followed him in submission to allah and this prophet and those who believe in his message and allah is the ally of the believers
3|69|a faction of the people of the scripture wish they could mislead you but they do not mislead except themselves and they perceive it not
3|70|o people of the scripture why do you disbelieve in the verses of allah while you witness to their truth
3|71|o people of the scripture why do you confuse the truth with falsehood and conceal the truth while you know it
3|72|and a faction of the people of the scripture say to each other believe in that which was revealed to the believers at the beginning of the day and reject it at its end that perhaps they will abandon their religion
3|73|and do not trust except those who follow your religion say indeed the true guidance is the guidance of allah do you fear lest someone be given knowledge like you were given or that they would thereby argue with you before your lord say indeed all bounty is in the hand of allah he grants it to whom he wills and allah is all encompassing and wise
3|74|he selects for his mercy whom he wills and allah is the possessor of great bounty
3|75|and among the people of the scripture is he who if you entrust him with a great amount of wealth he will return it to you and among them is he who if you entrust him with a single silver coin he will not return it to you unless you are constantly standing over him demanding it that is because they say there is no blame upon us concerning the unlearned and they speak untruth about allah while they know it
3|76|but yes whoever fulfills his commitment and fears allah then indeed allah loves those who fear him
3|77|indeed those who exchange the covenant of allah and their own oaths for a small price will have no share in the hereafter and allah will not speak to them or look at them on the day of resurrection nor will he purify them and they will have a painful punishment
3|78|and indeed there is among them a party who alter the scripture with their tongues so you may think it is from the scripture but it is not from the scripture and they say this is from allah but it is not from allah and they speak untruth about allah while they know
3|79|it is not for a human prophet that allah should give him the scripture and authority and prophethood and then he would say to the people be servants to me rather than allah but instead he would say be pious scholars of the lord because of what you have taught of the scripture and because of what you have studied
3|80|nor could he order you to take the angels and prophets as lords would he order you to disbelief after you had been muslims
3|81|and recall o people of the scripture when allah took the covenant of the prophets saying whatever i give you of the scripture and wisdom and then there comes to you a messenger confirming what is with you you must believe in him and support him allah said have you acknowledged and taken upon that my commitment they said we have acknowledged it he said then bear witness and i am with you among the witnesses
3|82|and whoever turned away after that they were the defiantly disobedient
3|83|so is it other than the religion of allah they desire while to him have submitted all those within the heavens and earth willingly or by compulsion and to him they will be returned
3|84|say we have believed in allah and in what was revealed to us and what was revealed to abraham ishmael isaac jacob and the descendants and in what was given to moses and jesus and to the prophets from their lord we make no distinction between any of them and we are muslims submitting to him
3|85|and whoever desires other than islam as religion never will it be accepted from him and he in the hereafter will be among the losers
3|86|how shall allah guide a people who disbelieved after their belief and had witnessed that the messenger is true and clear signs had come to them and allah does not guide the wrongdoing people
3|87|those their recompense will be that upon them is the curse of allah and the angels and the people all together
3|88|abiding eternally therein the punishment will not be lightened for them nor will they be reprieved
3|89|except for those who repent after that and correct themselves for indeed allah is forgiving and merciful
3|90|indeed those who reject the message after their belief and then increase in disbelief never will their claimed repentance be accepted and they are the ones astray
3|91|indeed those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers never would the whole capacity of the earth in gold be accepted from one of them if he would seek to ransom himself with it for those there will be a painful punishment and they will have no helpers
3|92|never will you attain the good reward until you spend in the way of allah from that which you love and whatever you spend indeed allah is knowing of it
3|93|all food was lawful to the children of israel except what israel had made unlawful to himself before the torah was revealed say o muhammad so bring the torah and recite it if you should be truthful
3|94|and whoever invents about allah untruth after that then those are truly the wrongdoers
3|95|say allah has told the truth so follow the religion of abraham inclining toward truth and he was not of the polytheists
3|96|indeed the first house of worship established for mankind was that at makkah blessed and a guidance for the worlds
3|97|in it are clear signs such as the standing place of abraham and whoever enters it shall be safe and due to allah from the people is a pilgrimage to the house for whoever is able to find thereto a way but whoever disbelieves then indeed allah is free from need of the worlds
3|98|say o people of the scripture why do you disbelieve in the verses of allah while allah is witness over what you do
3|99|say o people of the scripture why do you avert from the way of allah those who believe seeking to make it seem deviant while you are witnesses to the truth and allah is not unaware of what you do
3|100|o you who have believed if you obey a party of those who were given the scripture they would turn you back after your belief to being unbelievers
3|101|and how could you disbelieve while to you are being recited the verses of allah and among you is his messenger and whoever holds firmly to allah has indeed been guided to a straight path
3|102|o you who have believed fear allah as he should be feared and do not die except as muslims in submission to him
3|103|and hold firmly to the rope of allah all together and do not become divided and remember the favor of allah upon you when you were enemies and he brought your hearts together and you became by his favor brothers and you were on the edge of a pit of the fire and he saved you from it thus does allah make clear to you his verses that you may be guided
3|104|and let there be arising from you a nation inviting to all that is good enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong and those will be the successful
3|105|and do not be like the ones who became divided and differed after the clear proofs had come to them and those will have a great punishment
3|106|on the day some faces will turn white and some faces will turn black as for those whose faces turn black to them it will be said did you disbelieve after your belief then taste the punishment for what you used to reject
3|107|but as for those whose faces will turn white they will be within the mercy of allah they will abide therein eternally
3|108|these are the verses of allah we recite them to you o muhammad in truth and allah wants no injustice to the worlds
3|109|to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth and to allah will all matters be returned
3|110|you are the best nation produced as an example for mankind you enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and believe in allah if only the people of the scripture had believed it would have been better for them among them are believers but most of them are defiantly disobedient
3|111|they will not harm you except for some annoyance and if they fight you they will show you their backs then they will not be aided
3|112|they have been put under humiliation by allah wherever they are overtaken except for a covenant from allah and a rope from the muslims and they have drawn upon themselves anger from allah and have been put under destitution that is because they disbelieved in the verses of allah and killed the prophets without right that is because they disobeyed and habitually transgressed
3|113|they are not all the same among the people of the scripture is a community standing in obedience reciting the verses of allah during periods of the night and prostrating in prayer
3|114|they believe in allah and the last day and they enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and hasten to good deeds and those are among the righteous
3|115|and whatever good they do never will it be removed from them and allah is knowing of the righteous
3|116|indeed those who disbelieve never will their wealth or their children avail them against allah at all and those are the companions of the fire they will abide therein eternally
3|117|the example of what they spend in this worldly life is like that of a wind containing frost which strikes the harvest of a people who have wronged themselves and destroys it and allah has not wronged them but they wrong themselves
3|118|o you who have believed do not take as intimates those other than yourselves for they will not spare you any ruin they wish you would have hardship hatred has already appeared from their mouths and what their breasts conceal is greater we have certainly made clear to you the signs if you will use reason
3|119|here you are loving them but they are not loving you while you believe in the scripture all of it and when they meet you they say we believe but when they are alone they bite their fingertips at you in rage say die in your rage indeed allah is knowing of that within the breasts
3|120|if good touches you it distresses them but if harm strikes you they rejoice at it and if you are patient and fear allah their plot will not harm you at all indeed allah is encompassing of what they do
3|121|and remember when you o muhammad left your family in the morning to post the believers at their stations for the battle of uhud and allah is hearing and knowing
3|122|when two parties among you were about to lose courage but allah was their ally and upon allah the believers should rely
3|123|and already had allah given you victory at the battle of badr while you were few in number then fear allah perhaps you will be grateful
3|124|remember when you said to the believers is it not sufficient for you that your lord should reinforce you with three thousand angels sent down
3|125|yes if you remain patient and conscious of allah and the enemy come upon you attacking in rage your lord will reinforce you with five thousand angels having marks of distinction
3|126|and allah made it not except as a sign of good tidings for you and to reassure your hearts thereby and victory is not except from allah the exalted in might the wise
3|127|that he might cut down a section of the disbelievers or suppress them so that they turn back disappointed
3|128|not for you o muhammad but for allah is the decision whether he should cut them down or forgive them or punish them for indeed they are wrongdoers
3|129|and to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth he forgives whom he wills and punishes whom he wills and allah is forgiving and merciful
3|130|o you who have believed do not consume usury doubled and multiplied but fear allah that you may be successful
3|131|and fear the fire which has been prepared for the disbelievers
3|132|and obey allah and the messenger that you may obtain mercy
3|133|and hasten to forgiveness from your lord and a garden as wide as the heavens and earth prepared for the righteous
3|134|who spend in the cause of allah during ease and hardship and who restrain anger and who pardon the people and allah loves the doers of good
3|135|and those who when they commit an immorality or wrong themselves by transgression remember allah and seek forgiveness for their sins and who can forgive sins except allah and who do not persist in what they have done while they know
3|136|those their reward is forgiveness from their lord and gardens beneath which rivers flow in paradise wherein they will abide eternally and excellent is the reward of the righteous workers
3|137|similar situations as yours have passed on before you so proceed throughout the earth and observe how was the end of those who denied
3|138|this qur an is a clear statement to all the people and a guidance and instruction for those conscious of allah
3|139|so do not weaken and do not grieve and you will be superior if you are true believers
3|140|if a wound should touch you there has already touched the opposing people a wound similar to it and these days of varying conditions we alternate among the people so that allah may make evident those who believe and may take to himself from among you martyrs and allah does not like the wrongdoers
3|141|and that allah may purify the believers through trials and destroy the disbelievers
3|142|or do you think that you will enter paradise while allah has not yet made evident those of you who fight in his cause and made evident those who are steadfast
3|143|and you had certainly wished for martyrdom before you encountered it and you have now seen it before you while you were looking on
3|144|muhammad is not but a messenger other messengers have passed on before him so if he was to die or be killed would you turn back on your heels to unbelief and he who turns back on his heels will never harm allah at all but allah will reward the grateful
3|145|and it is not possible for one to die except by permission of allah at a decree determined and whoever desires the reward of this world we will give him thereof and whoever desires the reward of the hereafter we will give him thereof and we will reward the grateful
3|146|and how many a prophet fought and with him fought many religious scholars but they never lost assurance due to what afflicted them in the cause of allah nor did they weaken or submit and allah loves the steadfast
3|147|and their words were not but that they said our lord forgive us our sins and the excess committed in our affairs and plant firmly our feet and give us victory over the disbelieving people
3|148|so allah gave them the reward of this world and the good reward of the hereafter and allah loves the doers of good
3|149|o you who have believed if you obey those who disbelieve they will turn you back on your heels and you will then become losers
3|150|but allah is your protector and he is the best of helpers
3|151|we will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve for what they have associated with allah of which he had not sent down any authority and their refuge will be the fire and wretched is the residence of the wrongdoers
3|152|and allah had certainly fulfilled his promise to you when you were killing the enemy by his permission until the time when you lost courage and fell to disputing about the order given by the prophet and disobeyed after he had shown you that which you love among you are some who desire this world and among you are some who desire the hereafter then he turned you back from them defeated that he might test you and he has already forgiven you and allah is the possessor of bounty for the believers
3|153|remember when you fled and climbed the mountain without looking aside at anyone while the messenger was calling you from behind so allah repaid you with distress upon distress so you would not grieve for that which had escaped you of victory and spoils of war or for that which had befallen you of injury and death and allah is fully acquainted with what you do
3|154|then after distress he sent down upon you security in the form of drowsiness overcoming a faction of you while another faction worried about themselves thinking of allah other than the truth the thought of ignorance saying is there anything for us to have done in this matter say indeed the matter belongs completely to allah they conceal within themselves what they will not reveal to you they say if there was anything we could have done in the matter some of us would not have been killed right here say even if you had been inside your houses those decreed to be killed would have come out to their death beds it was so that allah might test what is in your breasts and purify what is in your hearts and allah is knowing of that within the breasts
3|155|indeed those of you who turned back on the day the two armies met it was satan who caused them to slip because of some blame they had earned but allah has already forgiven them indeed allah is forgiving and forbearing
3|156|o you who have believed do not be like those who disbelieved and said about their brothers when they traveled through the land or went out to fight if they had been with us they would not have died or have been killed so allah makes that misconception a regret within their hearts and it is allah who gives life and causes death and allah is seeing of what you do
3|157|and if you are killed in the cause of allah or die then forgiveness from allah and mercy are better than whatever they accumulate in this world
3|158|and whether you die or are killed unto allah you will be gathered
3|159|so by mercy from allah o muhammad you were lenient with them and if you had been rude in speech and harsh in heart they would have disbanded from about you so pardon them and ask forgiveness for them and consult them in the matter and when you have decided then rely upon allah indeed allah loves those who rely upon him
3|160|if allah should aid you no one can overcome you but if he should forsake you who is there that can aid you after him and upon allah let the believers rely
3|161|it is not attributable to any prophet that he would act unfaithfully in regard to war booty and whoever betrays taking unlawfully will come with what he took on the day of resurrection then will every soul be fully compensated for what it earned and they will not be wronged
3|162|so is one who pursues the pleasure of allah like one who brings upon himself the anger of allah and whose refuge is hell and wretched is the destination
3|163|they are varying degrees in the sight of allah and allah is seeing of whatever they do
3|164|certainly did allah confer great favor upon the believers when he sent among them a messenger from themselves reciting to them his verses and purifying them and teaching them the book and wisdom although they had been before in manifest error
3|165|why is it that when a single disaster struck you on the day of uhud although you had struck the enemy in the battle of badr with one twice as great you said from where is this say it is from yourselves indeed allah is over all things competent
3|166|and what struck you on the day the two armies met was by permission of allah that he might make evident the true believers
3|167|and that he might make evident those who are hypocrites for it was said to them come fight in the way of allah or at least defend they said if we had known there would be fighting we would have followed you they were nearer to disbelief that day than to faith saying with their mouths what was not in their hearts and allah is most knowing of what they conceal
3|168|those who said about their brothers while sitting at home if they had obeyed us they would not have been killed say then prevent death from yourselves if you should be truthful
3|169|and never think of those who have been killed in the cause of allah as dead rather they are alive with their lord receiving provision
3|170|rejoicing in what allah has bestowed upon them of his bounty and they receive good tidings about those to be martyred after them who have not yet joined them that there will be no fear concerning them nor will they grieve
3|171|they receive good tidings of favor from allah and bounty and of the fact that allah does not allow the reward of believers to be lost
3|172|those believers who responded to allah and the messenger after injury had struck them for those who did good among them and feared allah is a great reward
3|173|those to whom hypocrites said indeed the people have gathered against you so fear them but it merely increased them in faith and they said sufficient for us is allah and he is the best disposer of affairs
3|174|so they returned with favor from allah and bounty no harm having touched them and they pursued the pleasure of allah and allah is the possessor of great bounty
3|175|that is only satan who frightens you of his supporters so fear them not but fear me if you are indeed believers
3|176|and do not be grieved o muhammad by those who hasten into disbelief indeed they will never harm allah at all allah intends that he should give them no share in the hereafter and for them is a great punishment
3|177|indeed those who purchase disbelief in exchange for faith never will they harm allah at all and for them is a painful punishment
3|178|and let not those who disbelieve ever think that because we extend their time of enjoyment it is better for them we only extend it for them so that they may increase in sin and for them is a humiliating punishment
3|179|allah would not leave the believers in that state you are in presently until he separates the evil from the good nor would allah reveal to you the unseen but instead allah chooses of his messengers whom he wills so believe in allah and his messengers and if you believe and fear him then for you is a great reward
3|180|and let not those who greedily withhold what allah has given them of his bounty ever think that it is better for them rather it is worse for them their necks will be encircled by what they withheld on the day of resurrection and to allah belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth and allah with what you do is fully acquainted
3|181|allah has certainly heard the statement of those jews who said indeed allah is poor while we are rich we will record what they said and their killing of the prophets without right and will say taste the punishment of the burning fire
3|182|that is for what your hands have put forth and because allah is not ever unjust to his servants
3|183|they are those who said indeed allah has taken our promise not to believe any messenger until he brings us an offering which fire from heaven will consume say there have already come to you messengers before me with clear proofs and even that of which you speak so why did you kill them if you should be truthful
3|184|then if they deny you o muhammad so were messengers denied before you who brought clear proofs and written ordinances and the enlightening scripture
3|185|every soul will taste death and you will only be given your full compensation on the day of resurrection so he who is drawn away from the fire and admitted to paradise has attained his desire and what is the life of this world except the enjoyment of delusion
3|186|you will surely be tested in your possessions and in yourselves and you will surely hear from those who were given the scripture before you and from those who associate others with allah much abuse but if you are patient and fear allah indeed that is of the matters worthy of determination
3|187|and mention o muhammad when allah took a covenant from those who were given the scripture saying you must make it clear to the people and not conceal it but they threw it away behind their backs and exchanged it for a small price and wretched is that which they purchased
3|188|and never think that those who rejoice in what they have perpetrated and like to be praised for what they did not do never think them to be in safety from the punishment and for them is a painful punishment
3|189|and to allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and allah is over all things competent
3|190|indeed in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the night and the day are signs for those of understanding
3|191|who remember allah while standing or sitting or lying on their sides and give thought to the creation of the heavens and the earth saying our lord you did not create this aimlessly exalted are you above such a thing then protect us from the punishment of the fire
3|192|our lord indeed whoever you admit to the fire you have disgraced him and for the wrongdoers there are no helpers
3|193|our lord indeed we have heard a caller calling to faith saying believe in your lord and we have believed our lord so forgive us our sins and remove from us our misdeeds and cause us to die with the righteous
3|194|our lord and grant us what you promised us through your messengers and do not disgrace us on the day of resurrection indeed you do not fail in your promise
3|195|and their lord responded to them never will i allow to be lost the work of any worker among you whether male or female you are of one another so those who emigrated or were evicted from their homes or were harmed in my cause or fought or were killed i will surely remove from them their misdeeds and i will surely admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow as reward from allah and allah has with him the best reward
3|196|be not deceived by the uninhibited movement of the disbelievers throughout the land
3|197|it is but a small enjoyment then their final refuge is hell and wretched is the resting place
3|198|but those who feared their lord will have gardens beneath which rivers flow abiding eternally therein as accommodation from allah and that which is with allah is best for the righteous
3|199|and indeed among the people of the scripture are those who believe in allah and what was revealed to you and what was revealed to them being humbly submissive to allah they do not exchange the verses of allah for a small price those will have their reward with their lord indeed allah is swift in account
3|200|o you who have believed persevere and endure and remain stationed and fear allah that you may be successful
4|1|o mankind fear your lord who created you from one soul and created from it its mate and dispersed from both of them many men and women and fear allah through whom you ask one another and the wombs indeed allah is ever over you an observer
4|2|and give to the orphans their properties and do not substitute the defective of your own for the good of theirs and do not consume their properties into your own indeed that is ever a great sin
4|3|and if you fear that you will not deal justly with the orphan girls then marry those that please you of other women two or three or four but if you fear that you will not be just then marry only one or those your right hand possesses that is more suitable that you may not incline to injustice
4|4|and give the women upon marriage their bridal gifts graciously but if they give up willingly to you anything of it then take it in satisfaction and ease
4|5|and do not give the weak minded your property which allah has made a means of sustenance for you but provide for them with it and clothe them and speak to them words of appropriate kindness
4|6|and test the orphans in their abilities until they reach marriageable age then if you perceive in them sound judgement release their property to them and do not consume it excessively and quickly anticipating that they will grow up and whoever when acting as guardian is self sufficient should refrain from taking a fee and whoever is poor let him take according to what is acceptable then when you release their property to them bring witnesses upon them and sufficient is allah as accountant
4|7|for men is a share of what the parents and close relatives leave and for women is a share of what the parents and close relatives leave be it little or much an obligatory share
4|8|and when other relatives and orphans and the needy are present at the time of division then provide for them something out of the estate and speak to them words of appropriate kindness
4|9|and let those executors and guardians fear injustice as if they themselves had left weak offspring behind and feared for them so let them fear allah and speak words of appropriate justice
4|10|indeed those who devour the property of orphans unjustly are only consuming into their bellies fire and they will be burned in a blaze
4|11|allah instructs you concerning your children for the male what is equal to the share of two females but if there are only daughters two or more for them is two thirds of one s estate and if there is only one for her is half and for one s parents to each one of them is a sixth of his estate if he left children but if he had no children and the parents alone inherit from him then for his mother is one third and if he had brothers or sisters for his mother is a sixth after any bequest he may have made or debt your parents or your children you know not which of them are nearest to you in benefit these shares are an obligation imposed by allah indeed allah is ever knowing and wise
4|12|and for you is half of what your wives leave if they have no child but if they have a child for you is one fourth of what they leave after any bequest they may have made or debt and for the wives is one fourth if you leave no child but if you leave a child then for them is an eighth of what you leave after any bequest you may have made or debt and if a man or woman leaves neither ascendants nor descendants but has a brother or a sister then for each one of them is a sixth but if they are more than two they share a third after any bequest which was made or debt as long as there is no detriment caused this is an ordinance from allah and allah is knowing and forbearing
4|13|these are the limits set by allah and whoever obeys allah and his messenger will be admitted by him to gardens in paradise under which rivers flow abiding eternally therein and that is the great attainment
4|14|and whoever disobeys allah and his messenger and transgresses his limits he will put him into the fire to abide eternally therein and he will have a humiliating punishment
4|15|those who commit unlawful sexual intercourse of your women bring against them four witnesses from among you and if they testify confine the guilty women to houses until death takes them or allah ordains for them another way
4|16|and the two who commit it among you dishonor them both but if they repent and correct themselves leave them alone indeed allah is ever accepting of repentance and merciful
4|17|the repentance accepted by allah is only for those who do wrong in ignorance or carelessness and then repent soon after it is those to whom allah will turn in forgiveness and allah is ever knowing and wise
4|18|but repentance is not accepted of those who continue to do evil deeds up until when death comes to one of them he says indeed i have repented now or of those who die while they are disbelievers for them we have prepared a painful punishment
4|19|o you who have believed it is not lawful for you to inherit women by compulsion and do not make difficulties for them in order to take back part of what you gave them unless they commit a clear immorality and live with them in kindness for if you dislike them perhaps you dislike a thing and allah makes therein much good
4|20|but if you want to replace one wife with another and you have given one of them a great amount in gifts do not take back from it anything would you take it in injustice and manifest sin
4|21|and how could you take it while you have gone in unto each other and they have taken from you a solemn covenant
4|22|and do not marry those women whom your fathers married except what has already occurred indeed it was an immorality and hateful to allah and was evil as a way
4|23|prohibited to you for marriage are your mothers your daughters your sisters your father s sisters your mother s sisters your brother s daughters your sister s daughters your milk mothers who nursed you your sisters through nursing your wives mothers and your step daughters under your guardianship born of your wives unto whom you have gone in but if you have not gone in unto them there is no sin upon you and also prohibited are the wives of your sons who are from your own loins and that you take in marriage two sisters simultaneously except for what has already occurred indeed allah is ever forgiving and merciful
4|24|and also prohibited to you are all married women except those your right hands possess this is the decree of allah upon you and lawful to you are all others beyond these provided that you seek them in marriage with gifts from your property desiring chastity not unlawful sexual intercourse so for whatever you enjoy of marriage from them give them their due compensation as an obligation and there is no blame upon you for what you mutually agree to beyond the obligation indeed allah is ever knowing and wise
4|25|and whoever among you cannot find the means to marry free believing women then he may marry from those whom your right hands possess of believing slave girls and allah is most knowing about your faith you believers are of one another so marry them with the permission of their people and give them their due compensation according to what is acceptable they should be chaste neither of those who commit unlawful intercourse randomly nor those who take secret lovers but once they are sheltered in marriage if they should commit adultery then for them is half the punishment for free unmarried women this allowance is for him among you who fears sin but to be patient is better for you and allah is forgiving and merciful
4|26|allah wants to make clear to you the lawful from the unlawful and guide you to the good practices of those before you and to accept your repentance and allah is knowing and wise
4|27|allah wants to accept your repentance but those who follow their passions want you to digress into a great deviation
4|28|and allah wants to lighten for you your difficulties and mankind was created weak
4|29|o you who have believed do not consume one another s wealth unjustly but only in lawful business by mutual consent and do not kill yourselves or one another indeed allah is to you ever merciful
4|30|and whoever does that in aggression and injustice then we will drive him into a fire and that for allah is always easy
4|31|if you avoid the major sins which you are forbidden we will remove from you your lesser sins and admit you to a noble entrance into paradise
4|32|and do not wish for that by which allah has made some of you exceed others for men is a share of what they have earned and for women is a share of what they have earned and ask allah of his bounty indeed allah is ever of all things knowing
4|33|and for all we have made heirs to what is left by parents and relatives and to those whom your oaths have bound to you give them their share indeed allah is ever over all things a witness
4|34|men are in charge of women by right of what allah has given one over the other and what they spend for maintenance from their wealth so righteous women are devoutly obedient guarding in the husband s absence what allah would have them guard but those wives from whom you fear arrogance first advise them then if they persist forsake them in bed and finally strike them but if they obey you once more seek no means against them indeed allah is ever exalted and grand
4|35|and if you fear dissension between the two send an arbitrator from his people and an arbitrator from her people if they both desire reconciliation allah will cause it between them indeed allah is ever knowing and acquainted with all things
4|36|worship allah and associate nothing with him and to parents do good and to relatives orphans the needy the near neighbor the neighbor farther away the companion at your side the traveler and those whom your right hands possess indeed allah does not like those who are self deluding and boastful
4|37|who are stingy and enjoin upon other people stinginess and conceal what allah has given them of his bounty and we have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment
4|38|and also those who spend of their wealth to be seen by the people and believe not in allah nor in the last day and he to whom satan is a companion then evil is he as a companion
4|39|and what harm would come upon them if they believed in allah and the last day and spent out of what allah provided for them and allah is ever about them knowing
4|40|indeed allah does not do injustice even as much as an atom s weight while if there is a good deed he multiplies it and gives from himself a great reward
4|41|so how will it be when we bring from every nation a witness and we bring you o muhammad against these people as a witness
4|42|that day those who disbelieved and disobeyed the messenger will wish they could be covered by the earth and they will not conceal from allah a single statement
4|43|o you who have believed do not approach prayer while you are intoxicated until you know what you are saying or in a state of janabah except those passing through a place of prayer until you have washed your whole body and if you are ill or on a journey or one of you comes from the place of relieving himself or you have contacted women and find no water then seek clean earth and wipe over your faces and your hands with it indeed allah is ever pardoning and forgiving
4|44|have you not seen those who were given a portion of the scripture purchasing error in exchange for it and wishing you would lose the way
4|45|and allah is most knowing of your enemies and sufficient is allah as an ally and sufficient is allah as a helper
4|46|among the jews are those who distort words from their proper usages and say we hear and disobey and hear but be not heard and ra ina twisting their tongues and defaming the religion and if they had said instead we hear and obey and wait for us to understand it would have been better for them and more suitable but allah has cursed them for their disbelief so they believe not except for a few
4|47|o you who were given the scripture believe in what we have sent down to muhammad confirming that which is with you before we obliterate faces and turn them toward their backs or curse them as we cursed the sabbath breakers and ever is the decree of allah accomplished
4|48|indeed allah does not forgive association with him but he forgives what is less than that for whom he wills and he who associates others with allah has certainly fabricated a tremendous sin
4|49|have you not seen those who claim themselves to be pure rather allah purifies whom he wills and injustice is not done to them even as much as a thread inside a date seed
4|50|look how they invent about allah untruth and sufficient is that as a manifest sin
4|51|have you not seen those who were given a portion of the scripture who believe in superstition and false objects of worship and say about the disbelievers these are better guided than the believers as to the way
4|52|those are the ones whom allah has cursed and he whom allah curses never will you find for him a helper
4|53|or have they a share of dominion then if that were so they would not give the people even as much as the speck on a date seed
4|54|or do they envy people for what allah has given them of his bounty but we had already given the family of abraham the scripture and wisdom and conferred upon them a great kingdom
4|55|and some among them believed in it and some among them were averse to it and sufficient is hell as a blaze
4|56|indeed those who disbelieve in our verses we will drive them into a fire every time their skins are roasted through we will replace them with other skins so they may taste the punishment indeed allah is ever exalted in might and wise
4|57|but those who believe and do righteous deeds we will admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow wherein they abide forever for them therein are purified spouses and we will admit them to deepening shade
4|58|indeed allah commands you to render trusts to whom they are due and when you judge between people to judge with justice excellent is that which allah instructs you indeed allah is ever hearing and seeing
4|59|o you who have believed obey allah and obey the messenger and those in authority among you and if you disagree over anything refer it to allah and the messenger if you should believe in allah and the last day that is the best way and best in result
4|60|have you not seen those who claim to have believed in what was revealed to you o muhammad and what was revealed before you they wish to refer legislation to taghut while they were commanded to reject it and satan wishes to lead them far astray
4|61|and when it is said to them come to what allah has revealed and to the messenger you see the hypocrites turning away from you in aversion
4|62|so how will it be when disaster strikes them because of what their hands have put forth and then they come to you swearing by allah we intended nothing but good conduct and accommodation
4|63|those are the ones of whom allah knows what is in their hearts so turn away from them but admonish them and speak to them a far reaching word
4|64|and we did not send any messenger except to be obeyed by permission of allah and if when they wronged themselves they had come to you o muhammad and asked forgiveness of allah and the messenger had asked forgiveness for them they would have found allah accepting of repentance and merciful
4|65|but no by your lord they will not truly believe until they make you o muhammad judge concerning that over which they dispute among themselves and then find within themselves no discomfort from what you have judged and submit in full willing submission
4|66|and if we had decreed upon them kill yourselves or leave your homes they would not have done it except for a few of them but if they had done what they were instructed it would have been better for them and a firmer position for them in faith
4|67|and then we would have given them from us a great reward
4|68|and we would have guided them to a straight path
4|69|and whoever obeys allah and the messenger those will be with the ones upon whom allah has bestowed favor of the prophets the steadfast affirmers of truth the martyrs and the righteous and excellent are those as companions
4|70|that is the bounty from allah and sufficient is allah as knower
4|71|o you who have believed take your precaution and either go forth in companies or go forth all together
4|72|and indeed there is among you he who lingers behind and if disaster strikes you he says allah has favored me in that i was not present with them
4|73|but if bounty comes to you from allah he will surely say as if there had never been between you and him any affection oh i wish i had been with them so i could have attained a great attainment
4|74|so let those fight in the cause of allah who sell the life of this world for the hereafter and he who fights in the cause of allah and is killed or achieves victory we will bestow upon him a great reward
4|75|and what is the matter with you that you fight not in the cause of allah and for the oppressed among men women and children who say our lord take us out of this city of oppressive people and appoint for us from yourself a protector and appoint for us from yourself a helper
4|76|those who believe fight in the cause of allah and those who disbelieve fight in the cause of taghut so fight against the allies of satan indeed the plot of satan has ever been weak
4|77|have you not seen those who were told restrain your hands from fighting and establish prayer and give zakah but then when fighting was ordained for them at once a party of them feared men as they fear allah or with even greater fear they said our lord why have you decreed upon us fighting if only you had postponed it for us for a short time say the enjoyment of this world is little and the hereafter is better for he who fears allah and injustice will not be done to you even as much as a thread inside a date seed
4|78|wherever you may be death will overtake you even if you should be within towers of lofty construction but if good comes to them they say this is from allah and if evil befalls them they say this is from you say all things are from allah so what is the matter with those people that they can hardly understand any statement
4|79|what comes to you of good is from allah but what comes to you of evil o man is from yourself and we have sent you o muhammad to the people as a messenger and sufficient is allah as witness
4|80|he who obeys the messenger has obeyed allah but those who turn away we have not sent you over them as a guardian
4|81|and they say we pledge obedience but when they leave you a group of them spend the night determining to do other than what you say but allah records what they plan by night so leave them alone and rely upon allah and sufficient is allah as disposer of affairs
4|82|then do they not reflect upon the qur an if it had been from any other than allah they would have found within it much contradiction
4|83|and when there comes to them information about public security or fear they spread it around but if they had referred it back to the messenger or to those of authority among them then the ones who can draw correct conclusions from it would have known about it and if not for the favor of allah upon you and his mercy you would have followed satan except for a few
4|84|so fight o muhammad in the cause of allah you are not held responsible except for yourself and encourage the believers to join you that perhaps allah will restrain the military might of those who disbelieve and allah is greater in might and stronger in exemplary punishment
4|85|whoever intercedes for a good cause will have a reward therefrom and whoever intercedes for an evil cause will have a burden therefrom and ever is allah over all things a keeper
4|86|and when you are greeted with a greeting greet in return with one better than it or at least return it in a like manner indeed allah is ever over all things an accountant
4|87|allah there is no deity except him he will surely assemble you for account on the day of resurrection about which there is no doubt and who is more truthful than allah in statement
4|88|what is the matter with you that you are two groups concerning the hypocrites while allah has made them fall back into error and disbelief for what they earned do you wish to guide those whom allah has sent astray and he whom allah sends astray never will you find for him a way of guidance
4|89|they wish you would disbelieve as they disbelieved so you would be alike so do not take from among them allies until they emigrate for the cause of allah but if they turn away then seize them and kill them wherever you find them and take not from among them any ally or helper
4|90|except for those who take refuge with a people between yourselves and whom is a treaty or those who come to you their hearts strained at the prospect of fighting you or fighting their own people and if allah had willed he could have given them power over you and they would have fought you so if they remove themselves from you and do not fight you and offer you peace then allah has not made for you a cause for fighting against them
4|91|you will find others who wish to obtain security from you and to obtain security from their people every time they are returned to the influence of disbelief they fall back into it so if they do not withdraw from you or offer you peace or restrain their hands then seize them and kill them wherever you overtake them and those we have made for you against them a clear authorization
4|92|and never is it for a believer to kill a believer except by mistake and whoever kills a believer by mistake then the freeing of a believing slave and a compensation payment presented to the deceased s family is required unless they give up their right as charity but if the deceased was from a people at war with you and he was a believer then only the freeing of a believing slave and if he was from a people with whom you have a treaty then a compensation payment presented to his family and the freeing of a believing slave and whoever does not find one or cannot afford to buy one then instead a fast for two months consecutively seeking acceptance of repentance from allah and allah is ever knowing and wise
4|93|but whoever kills a believer intentionally his recompense is hell wherein he will abide eternally and allah has become angry with him and has cursed him and has prepared for him a great punishment
4|94|o you who have believed when you go forth to fight in the cause of allah investigate and do not say to one who gives you a greeting of peace you are not a believer aspiring for the goods of worldly life for with allah are many acquisitions you yourselves were like that before then allah conferred his favor upon you so investigate indeed allah is ever with what you do acquainted
4|95|not equal are those believers remaining at home other than the disabled and the mujahideen who strive and fight in the cause of allah with their wealth and their lives allah has preferred the mujahideen through their wealth and their lives over those who remain behind by degrees and to both allah has promised the best reward but allah has preferred the mujahideen over those who remain behind with a great reward
4|96|degrees of high position from him and forgiveness and mercy and allah is ever forgiving and merciful
4|97|indeed those whom the angels take in death while wronging themselves the angels will say in what condition were you they will say we were oppressed in the land the angels will say was not the earth of allah spacious enough for you to emigrate therein for those their refuge is hell and evil it is as a destination
4|98|except for the oppressed among men women and children who cannot devise a plan nor are they directed to a way
4|99|for those it is expected that allah will pardon them and allah is ever pardoning and forgiving
4|100|and whoever emigrates for the cause of allah will find on the earth many alternative locations and abundance and whoever leaves his home as an emigrant to allah and his messenger and then death overtakes him his reward has already become incumbent upon allah and allah is ever forgiving and merciful
4|101|and when you travel throughout the land there is no blame upon you for shortening the prayer especially if you fear that those who disbelieve may disrupt or attack you indeed the disbelievers are ever to you a clear enemy
4|102|and when you are among them and lead them in prayer let a group of them stand in prayer with you and let them carry their arms and when they have prostrated let them be in position behind you and have the other group come forward which has not yet prayed and let them pray with you taking precaution and carrying their arms those who disbelieve wish that you would neglect your weapons and your baggage so they could come down upon you in one single attack but there is no blame upon you if you are troubled by rain or are ill for putting down your arms but take precaution indeed allah has prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment
4|103|and when you have completed the prayer remember allah standing sitting or lying on your sides but when you become secure re establish regular prayer indeed prayer has been decreed upon the believers a decree of specified times
4|104|and do not weaken in pursuit of the enemy if you should be suffering so are they suffering as you are suffering but you expect from allah that which they expect not and allah is ever knowing and wise
4|105|indeed we have revealed to you o muhammad the book in truth so you may judge between the people by that which allah has shown you and do not be for the deceitful an advocate
4|106|and seek forgiveness of allah indeed allah is ever forgiving and merciful
4|107|and do not argue on behalf of those who deceive themselves indeed allah loves not one who is a habitually sinful deceiver
4|108|they conceal their evil intentions and deeds from the people but they cannot conceal them from allah and he is with them in his knowledge when they spend the night in such as he does not accept of speech and ever is allah of what they do encompassing
4|109|here you are those who argue on their behalf in this worldly life but who will argue with allah for them on the day of resurrection or who will then be their representative
4|110|and whoever does a wrong or wrongs himself but then seeks forgiveness of allah will find allah forgiving and merciful
4|111|and whoever commits a sin only earns it against himself and allah is ever knowing and wise
4|112|but whoever earns an offense or a sin and then blames it on an innocent person has taken upon himself a slander and manifest sin
4|113|and if it was not for the favor of allah upon you o muhammad and his mercy a group of them would have determined to mislead you but they do not mislead except themselves and they will not harm you at all and allah has revealed to you the book and wisdom and has taught you that which you did not know and ever has the favor of allah upon you been great
4|114|no good is there in much of their private conversation except for those who enjoin charity or that which is right or conciliation between people and whoever does that seeking means to the approval of allah then we are going to give him a great reward
4|115|and whoever opposes the messenger after guidance has become clear to him and follows other than the way of the believers we will give him what he has taken and drive him into hell and evil it is as a destination
4|116|indeed allah does not forgive association with him but he forgives what is less than that for whom he wills and he who associates others with allah has certainly gone far astray
4|117|they call upon instead of him none but female deities and they actually call upon none but a rebellious satan
4|118|whom allah has cursed for he had said i will surely take from among your servants a specific portion
4|119|and i will mislead them and i will arouse in them sinful desires and i will command them so they will slit the ears of cattle and i will command them so they will change the creation of allah and whoever takes satan as an ally instead of allah has certainly sustained a clear loss
4|120|satan promises them and arouses desire in them but satan does not promise them except delusion
4|121|the refuge of those will be hell and they will not find from it an escape
4|122|but the ones who believe and do righteous deeds we will admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide forever it is the promise of allah which is truth and who is more truthful than allah in statement
4|123|paradise is not obtained by your wishful thinking nor by that of the people of the scripture whoever does a wrong will be recompensed for it and he will not find besides allah a protector or a helper
4|124|and whoever does righteous deeds whether male or female while being a believer those will enter paradise and will not be wronged even as much as the speck on a date seed
4|125|and who is better in religion than one who submits himself to allah while being a doer of good and follows the religion of abraham inclining toward truth and allah took abraham as an intimate friend
4|126|and to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth and ever is allah of all things encompassing
4|127|and they request from you o muhammad a legal ruling concerning women say allah gives you a ruling about them and about what has been recited to you in the book concerning the orphan girls to whom you do not give what is decreed for them and yet you desire to marry them and concerning the oppressed among children and that you maintain for orphans their rights in justice and whatever you do of good indeed allah is ever knowing of it
4|128|and if a woman fears from her husband contempt or evasion there is no sin upon them if they make terms of settlement between them and settlement is best and present in human souls is stinginess but if you do good and fear allah then indeed allah is ever with what you do acquainted
4|129|and you will never be able to be equal in feeling between wives even if you should strive to do so so do not incline completely toward one and leave another hanging and if you amend your affairs and fear allah then indeed allah is ever forgiving and merciful
4|130|but if they separate by divorce allah will enrich each of them from his abundance and ever is allah encompassing and wise
4|131|and to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth and we have instructed those who were given the scripture before you and yourselves to fear allah but if you disbelieve then to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth and ever is allah free of need and praiseworthy
4|132|and to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth and sufficient is allah as disposer of affairs
4|133|if he wills he can do away with you o people and bring others in your place and ever is allah competent to do that
4|134|whoever desires the reward of this world then with allah is the reward of this world and the hereafter and ever is allah hearing and seeing
4|135|o you who have believed be persistently standing firm in justice witnesses for allah even if it be against yourselves or parents and relatives whether one is rich or poor allah is more worthy of both so follow not personal inclination lest you not be just and if you distort your testimony or refuse to give it then indeed allah is ever with what you do acquainted
4|136|o you who have believed believe in allah and his messenger and the book that he sent down upon his messenger and the scripture which he sent down before and whoever disbelieves in allah his angels his books his messengers and the last day has certainly gone far astray
4|137|indeed those who have believed then disbelieved then believed then disbelieved and then increased in disbelief never will allah forgive them nor will he guide them to a way
4|138|give tidings to the hypocrites that there is for them a painful punishment
4|139|those who take disbelievers as allies instead of the believers do they seek with them honor through power but indeed honor belongs to allah entirely
4|140|and it has already come down to you in the book that when you hear the verses of allah recited they are denied by them and ridiculed so do not sit with them until they enter into another conversation indeed you would then be like them indeed allah will gather the hypocrites and disbelievers in hell all together
4|141|those who wait and watch you then if you gain a victory from allah they say were we not with you but if the disbelievers have a success they say to them did we not gain the advantage over you but we protected you from the believers allah will judge between all of you on the day of resurrection and never will allah give the disbelievers over the believers a way to overcome them
4|142|indeed the hypocrites think to deceive allah but he is deceiving them and when they stand for prayer they stand lazily showing themselves to the people and not remembering allah except a little
4|143|wavering between them belonging neither to the believers nor to the disbelievers and whoever allah leaves astray never will you find for him a way
4|144|o you who have believed do not take the disbelievers as allies instead of the believers do you wish to give allah against yourselves a clear case
4|145|indeed the hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of the fire and never will you find for them a helper
4|146|except for those who repent correct themselves hold fast to allah and are sincere in their religion for allah for those will be with the believers and allah is going to give the believers a great reward
4|147|what would allah do with your punishment if you are grateful and believe and ever is allah appreciative and knowing
4|148|allah does not like the public mention of evil except by one who has been wronged and ever is allah hearing and knowing
4|149|if instead you show some good or conceal it or pardon an offense indeed allah is ever pardoning and competent
4|150|indeed those who disbelieve in allah and his messengers and wish to discriminate between allah and his messengers and say we believe in some and disbelieve in others and wish to adopt a way in between
4|151|those are the disbelievers truly and we have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment
4|152|but they who believe in allah and his messengers and do not discriminate between any of them to those he is going to give their rewards and ever is allah forgiving and merciful
4|153|the people of the scripture ask you to bring down to them a book from the heaven but they had asked of moses even greater than that and said show us allah outright so the thunderbolt struck them for their wrongdoing then they took the calf for worship after clear evidences had come to them and we pardoned that and we gave moses a clear authority
4|154|and we raised over them the mount for refusal of their covenant and we said to them enter the gate bowing humbly and we said to them do not transgress on the sabbath and we took from them a solemn covenant
4|155|and we cursed them for their breaking of the covenant and their disbelief in the signs of allah and their killing of the prophets without right and their saying our hearts are wrapped rather allah has sealed them because of their disbelief so they believe not except for a few
4|156|and we cursed them for their disbelief and their saying against mary a great slander
4|157|and for their saying indeed we have killed the messiah jesus the son of mary the messenger of allah and they did not kill him nor did they crucify him but another was made to resemble him to them and indeed those who differ over it are in doubt about it they have no knowledge of it except the following of assumption and they did not kill him for certain
4|158|rather allah raised him to himself and ever is allah exalted in might and wise
4|159|and there is none from the people of the scripture but that he will surely believe in jesus before his death and on the day of resurrection he will be against them a witness
4|160|for wrongdoing on the part of the jews we made unlawful for them certain good foods which had been lawful to them and for their averting from the way of allah many people
4|161|and for their taking of usury while they had been forbidden from it and their consuming of the people s wealth unjustly and we have prepared for the disbelievers among them a painful punishment
4|162|but those firm in knowledge among them and the believers believe in what has been revealed to you o muhammad and what was revealed before you and the establishers of prayer especially and the givers of zakah and the believers in allah and the last day those we will give a great reward
4|163|indeed we have revealed to you o muhammad as we revealed to noah and the prophets after him and we revealed to abraham ishmael isaac jacob the descendants jesus job jonah aaron and solomon and to david we gave the book of psalms
4|164|and we sent messengers about whom we have related their stories to you before and messengers about whom we have not related to you and allah spoke to moses with direct speech
4|165|we sent messengers as bringers of good tidings and warners so that mankind will have no argument against allah after the messengers and ever is allah exalted in might and wise
4|166|but allah bears witness to that which he has revealed to you he has sent it down with his knowledge and the angels bear witness as well and sufficient is allah as witness
4|167|indeed those who disbelieve and avert people from the way of allah have certainly gone far astray
4|168|indeed those who disbelieve and commit wrong or injustice never will allah forgive them nor will he guide them to a path
4|169|except the path of hell they will abide therein forever and that for allah is always easy
4|170|o mankind the messenger has come to you with the truth from your lord so believe it is better for you but if you disbelieve then indeed to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and earth and ever is allah knowing and wise
4|171|o people of the scripture do not commit excess in your religion or say about allah except the truth the messiah jesus the son of mary was but a messenger of allah and his word which he directed to mary and a soul created at a command from him so believe in allah and his messengers and do not say three desist it is better for you indeed allah is but one god exalted is he above having a son to him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth and sufficient is allah as disposer of affairs
4|172|never would the messiah disdain to be a servant of allah nor would the angels near to him and whoever disdains his worship and is arrogant he will gather them to himself all together
4|173|and as for those who believed and did righteous deeds he will give them in full their rewards and grant them extra from his bounty but as for those who disdained and were arrogant he will punish them with a painful punishment and they will not find for themselves besides allah any protector or helper
4|174|o mankind there has come to you a conclusive proof from your lord and we have sent down to you a clear light
4|175|so those who believe in allah and hold fast to him he will admit them to mercy from himself and bounty and guide them to himself on a straight path
4|176|they request from you a legal ruling say allah gives you a ruling concerning one having neither descendants nor ascendants as heirs if a man dies leaving no child but only a sister she will have half of what he left and he inherits from her if she dies and has no child but if there are two sisters or more they will have two thirds of what he left if there are both brothers and sisters the male will have the share of two females allah makes clear to you his law lest you go astray and allah is knowing of all things
5|1|o you who have believed fulfill all contracts lawful for you are the animals of grazing livestock except for that which is recited to you in this qur an hunting not being permitted while you are in the state of ihram indeed allah ordains what he intends
5|2|o you who have believed do not violate the rites of allah or the sanctity of the sacred month or neglect the marking of the sacrificial animals and garlanding them or violate the safety of those coming to the sacred house seeking bounty from their lord and his approval but when you come out of ihram then you may hunt and do not let the hatred of a people for having obstructed you from al masjid al haram lead you to transgress and cooperate in righteousness and piety but do not cooperate in sin and aggression and fear allah indeed allah is severe in penalty
5|3|prohibited to you are dead animals blood the flesh of swine and that which has been dedicated to other than allah and those animals killed by strangling or by a violent blow or by a head long fall or by the goring of horns and those from which a wild animal has eaten except what you are able to slaughter before its death and those which are sacrificed on stone altars and prohibited is that you seek decision through divining arrows that is grave disobedience this day those who disbelieve have despaired of defeating your religion so fear them not but fear me this day i have perfected for you your religion and completed my favor upon you and have approved for you islam as religion but whoever is forced by severe hunger with no inclination to sin then indeed allah is forgiving and merciful
5|4|they ask you o muhammad what has been made lawful for them say lawful for you are all good foods and game caught by what you have trained of hunting animals which you train as allah has taught you so eat of what they catch for you and mention the name of allah upon it and fear allah indeed allah is swift in account
5|5|this day all good foods have been made lawful and the food of those who were given the scripture is lawful for you and your food is lawful for them and lawful in marriage are chaste women from among the believers and chaste women from among those who were given the scripture before you when you have given them their due compensation desiring chastity not unlawful sexual intercourse or taking secret lovers and whoever denies the faith his work has become worthless and he in the hereafter will be among the losers
5|6|o you who have believed when you rise to perform prayer wash your faces and your forearms to the elbows and wipe over your heads and wash your feet to the ankles and if you are in a state of janabah then purify yourselves but if you are ill or on a journey or one of you comes from the place of relieving himself or you have contacted women and do not find water then seek clean earth and wipe over your faces and hands with it allah does not intend to make difficulty for you but he intends to purify you and complete his favor upon you that you may be grateful
5|7|and remember the favor of allah upon you and his covenant with which he bound you when you said we hear and we obey and fear allah indeed allah is knowing of that within the breasts
5|8|o you who have believed be persistently standing firm for allah witnesses in justice and do not let the hatred of a people prevent you from being just be just that is nearer to righteousness and fear allah indeed allah is acquainted with what you do
5|9|allah has promised those who believe and do righteous deeds that for them there is forgiveness and great reward
5|10|but those who disbelieve and deny our signs those are the companions of hellfire
5|11|o you who have believed remember the favor of allah upon you when a people determined to extend their hands in aggression against you but he withheld their hands from you and fear allah and upon allah let the believers rely
5|12|and allah had already taken a covenant from the children of israel and we delegated from among them twelve leaders and allah said i am with you if you establish prayer and give zakah and believe in my messengers and support them and loan allah a goodly loan i will surely remove from you your misdeeds and admit you to gardens beneath which rivers flow but whoever of you disbelieves after that has certainly strayed from the soundness of the way
5|13|so for their breaking of the covenant we cursed them and made their hearts hard they distort words from their proper usages and have forgotten a portion of that of which they were reminded and you will still observe deceit among them except a few of them but pardon them and overlook their misdeeds indeed allah loves the doers of good
5|14|and from those who say we are christians we took their covenant but they forgot a portion of that of which they were reminded so we caused among them animosity and hatred until the day of resurrection and allah is going to inform them about what they used to do
5|15|o people of the scripture there has come to you our messenger making clear to you much of what you used to conceal of the scripture and overlooking much there has come to you from allah a light and a clear book
5|16|by which allah guides those who pursue his pleasure to the ways of peace and brings them out from darknesses into the light by his permission and guides them to a straight path
5|17|they have certainly disbelieved who say that allah is christ the son of mary say then who could prevent allah at all if he had intended to destroy christ the son of mary or his mother or everyone on the earth and to allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them he creates what he wills and allah is over all things competent
5|18|but the jews and the christians say we are the children of allah and his beloved say then why does he punish you for your sins rather you are human beings from among those he has created he forgives whom he wills and he punishes whom he wills and to allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them and to him is the final destination
5|19|o people of the scripture there has come to you our messenger to make clear to you the religion after a period of suspension of messengers lest you say there came not to us any bringer of good tidings or a warner but there has come to you a bringer of good tidings and a warner and allah is over all things competent
5|20|and mention o muhammad when moses said to his people o my people remember the favor of allah upon you when he appointed among you prophets and made you possessors and gave you that which he had not given anyone among the worlds
5|21|o my people enter the holy land which allah has assigned to you and do not turn back from fighting in allah s cause and thus become losers
5|22|they said o moses indeed within it is a people of tyrannical strength and indeed we will never enter it until they leave it but if they leave it then we will enter
5|23|said two men from those who feared to disobey upon whom allah had bestowed favor enter upon them through the gate for when you have entered it you will be predominant and upon allah rely if you should be believers
5|24|they said o moses indeed we will not enter it ever as long as they are within it so go you and your lord and fight indeed we are remaining right here
5|25|moses said my lord indeed i do not possess except myself and my brother so part us from the defiantly disobedient people
5|26|allah said then indeed it is forbidden to them for forty years in which they will wander throughout the land so do not grieve over the defiantly disobedient people
5|27|and recite to them the story of adam s two sons in truth when they both offered a sacrifice to allah and it was accepted from one of them but was not accepted from the other said the latter i will surely kill you said the former indeed allah only accepts from the righteous who fear him
5|28|if you should raise your hand against me to kill me i shall not raise my hand against you to kill you indeed i fear allah lord of the worlds
5|29|indeed i want you to obtain thereby my sin and your sin so you will be among the companions of the fire and that is the recompense of wrongdoers
5|30|and his soul permitted to him the murder of his brother so he killed him and became among the losers
5|31|then allah sent a crow searching in the ground to show him how to hide the disgrace of his brother he said o woe to me have i failed to be like this crow and hide the body of my brother and he became of the regretful
5|32|because of that we decreed upon the children of israel that whoever kills a soul unless for a soul or for corruption done in the land it is as if he had slain mankind entirely and whoever saves one it is as if he had saved mankind entirely and our messengers had certainly come to them with clear proofs then indeed many of them even after that throughout the land were transgressors
5|33|indeed the penalty for those who wage war against allah and his messenger and strive upon earth to cause corruption is none but that they be killed or crucified or that their hands and feet be cut off from opposite sides or that they be exiled from the land that is for them a disgrace in this world and for them in the hereafter is a great punishment
5|34|except for those who return repenting before you apprehend them and know that allah is forgiving and merciful
5|35|o you who have believed fear allah and seek the means of nearness to him and strive in his cause that you may succeed
5|36|indeed those who disbelieve if they should have all that is in the earth and the like of it with it by which to ransom themselves from the punishment of the day of resurrection it will not be accepted from them and for them is a painful punishment
5|37|they will wish to get out of the fire but never are they to emerge therefrom and for them is an enduring punishment
5|38|as for the thief the male and the female amputate their hands in recompense for what they committed as a deterrent punishment from allah and allah is exalted in might and wise
5|39|but whoever repents after his wrongdoing and reforms indeed allah will turn to him in forgiveness indeed allah is forgiving and merciful
5|40|do you not know that to allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth he punishes whom he wills and forgives whom he wills and allah is over all things competent
5|41|o messenger let them not grieve you who hasten into disbelief of those who say we believe with their mouths but their hearts believe not and from among the jews they are avid listeners to falsehood listening to another people who have not come to you they distort words beyond their proper usages saying if you are given this take it but if you are not given it then beware but he for whom allah intends fitnah never will you possess power to do for him a thing against allah those are the ones for whom allah does not intend to purify their hearts for them in this world is disgrace and for them in the hereafter is a great punishment
5|42|they are avid listeners to falsehood devourers of what is unlawful so if they come to you o muhammad judge between them or turn away from them and if you turn away from them never will they harm you at all and if you judge judge between them with justice indeed allah loves those who act justly
5|43|but how is it that they come to you for judgement while they have the torah in which is the judgement of allah then they turn away even after that but those are not in fact believers
5|44|indeed we sent down the torah in which was guidance and light the prophets who submitted to allah judged by it for the jews as did the rabbis and scholars by that with which they were entrusted of the scripture of allah and they were witnesses thereto so do not fear the people but fear me and do not exchange my verses for a small price and whoever does not judge by what allah has revealed then it is those who are the disbelievers
5|45|and we ordained for them therein a life for a life an eye for an eye a nose for a nose an ear for an ear a tooth for a tooth and for wounds is legal retribution but whoever gives up his right as charity it is an expiation for him and whoever does not judge by what allah has revealed then it is those who are the wrongdoers
5|46|and we sent following in their footsteps jesus the son of mary confirming that which came before him in the torah and we gave him the gospel in which was guidance and light and confirming that which preceded it of the torah as guidance and instruction for the righteous
5|47|and let the people of the gospel judge by what allah has revealed therein and whoever does not judge by what allah has revealed then it is those who are the defiantly disobedient
5|48|and we have revealed to you o muhammad the book in truth confirming that which preceded it of the scripture and as a criterion over it so judge between them by what allah has revealed and do not follow their inclinations away from what has come to you of the truth to each of you we prescribed a law and a method had allah willed he would have made you one nation united in religion but he intended to test you in what he has given you so race to all that is good to allah is your return all together and he will then inform you concerning that over which you used to differ
5|49|and judge o muhammad between them by what allah has revealed and do not follow their inclinations and beware of them lest they tempt you away from some of what allah has revealed to you and if they turn away then know that allah only intends to afflict them with some of their own sins and indeed many among the people are defiantly disobedient
5|50|then is it the judgement of the time of ignorance they desire but who is better than allah in judgement for a people who are certain in faith
5|51|o you who have believed do not take the jews and the christians as allies they are in fact allies of one another and whoever is an ally to them among you then indeed he is one of them indeed allah guides not the wrongdoing people
5|52|so you see those in whose hearts is disease hastening into association with them saying we are afraid a misfortune may strike us but perhaps allah will bring conquest or a decision from him and they will become over what they have been concealing within themselves regretful
5|53|and those who believe will say are these the ones who swore by allah their strongest oaths that indeed they were with you their deeds have become worthless and they have become losers
5|54|o you who have believed whoever of you should revert from his religion allah will bring forth in place of them a people he will love and who will love him who are humble toward the believers powerful against the disbelievers they strive in the cause of allah and do not fear the blame of a critic that is the favor of allah he bestows it upon whom he wills and allah is all encompassing and knowing
5|55|your ally is none but allah and therefore his messenger and those who have believed those who establish prayer and give zakah and they bow in worship
5|56|and whoever is an ally of allah and his messenger and those who have believed indeed the party of allah they will be the predominant
5|57|o you who have believed take not those who have taken your religion in ridicule and amusement among the ones who were given the scripture before you nor the disbelievers as allies and fear allah if you should truly be believers
5|58|and when you call to prayer they take it in ridicule and amusement that is because they are a people who do not use reason
5|59|say o people of the scripture do you resent us except for the fact that we have believed in allah and what was revealed to us and what was revealed before and because most of you are defiantly disobedient
5|60|say shall i inform you of what is worse than that as penalty from allah it is that of those whom allah has cursed and with whom he became angry and made of them apes and pigs and slaves of taghut those are worse in position and further astray from the sound way
5|61|and when they come to you they say we believe but they have entered with disbelief in their hearts and they have certainly left with it and allah is most knowing of what they were concealing
5|62|and you see many of them hastening into sin and aggression and the devouring of what is unlawful how wretched is what they have been doing
5|63|why do the rabbis and religious scholars not forbid them from saying what is sinful and devouring what is unlawful how wretched is what they have been practicing
5|64|and the jews say the hand of allah is chained chained are their hands and cursed are they for what they say rather both his hands are extended he spends however he wills and that which has been revealed to you from your lord will surely increase many of them in transgression and disbelief and we have cast among them animosity and hatred until the day of resurrection every time they kindled the fire of war against you allah extinguished it and they strive throughout the land causing corruption and allah does not like corrupters
5|65|and if only the people of the scripture had believed and feared allah we would have removed from them their misdeeds and admitted them to gardens of pleasure
5|66|and if only they upheld the law of the torah the gospel and what has been revealed to them from their lord they would have consumed provision from above them and from beneath their feet among them are a moderate community but many of them evil is that which they do
5|67|o messenger announce that which has been revealed to you from your lord and if you do not then you have not conveyed his message and allah will protect you from the people indeed allah does not guide the disbelieving people
5|68|say o people of the scripture you are standing on nothing until you uphold the law of the torah the gospel and what has been revealed to you from your lord and that which has been revealed to you from your lord will surely increase many of them in transgression and disbelief so do not grieve over the disbelieving people
5|69|indeed those who have believed in prophet muhammad and those before him who were jews or sabeans or christians those among them who believed in allah and the last day and did righteousness no fear will there be concerning them nor will they grieve
5|70|we had already taken the covenant of the children of israel and had sent to them messengers whenever there came to them a messenger with what their souls did not desire a party of messengers they denied and another party they killed
5|71|and they thought there would be no resulting punishment so they became blind and deaf then allah turned to them in forgiveness then again many of them became blind and deaf and allah is seeing of what they do
5|72|they have certainly disbelieved who say allah is the messiah the son of mary while the messiah has said o children of israel worship allah my lord and your lord indeed he who associates others with allah allah has forbidden him paradise and his refuge is the fire and there are not for the wrongdoers any helpers
5|73|they have certainly disbelieved who say allah is the third of three and there is no god except one god and if they do not desist from what they are saying there will surely afflict the disbelievers among them a painful punishment
5|74|so will they not repent to allah and seek his forgiveness and allah is forgiving and merciful
5|75|the messiah son of mary was not but a messenger other messengers have passed on before him and his mother was a supporter of truth they both used to eat food look how we make clear to them the signs then look how they are deluded
5|76|say do you worship besides allah that which holds for you no power of harm or benefit while it is allah who is the hearing the knowing
5|77|say o people of the scripture do not exceed limits in your religion beyond the truth and do not follow the inclinations of a people who had gone astray before and misled many and have strayed from the soundness of the way
5|78|cursed were those who disbelieved among the children of israel by the tongue of david and of jesus the son of mary that was because they disobeyed and habitually transgressed
5|79|they used not to prevent one another from wrongdoing that they did how wretched was that which they were doing
5|80|you see many of them becoming allies of those who disbelieved how wretched is that which they have put forth for themselves in that allah has become angry with them and in the punishment they will abide eternally
5|81|and if they had believed in allah and the prophet and in what was revealed to him they would not have taken them as allies but many of them are defiantly disobedient
5|82|you will surely find the most intense of the people in animosity toward the believers to be the jews and those who associate others with allah and you will find the nearest of them in affection to the believers those who say we are christians that is because among them are priests and monks and because they are not arrogant
5|83|and when they hear what has been revealed to the messenger you see their eyes overflowing with tears because of what they have recognized of the truth they say our lord we have believed so register us among the witnesses
5|84|and why should we not believe in allah and what has come to us of the truth and we aspire that our lord will admit us to paradise with the righteous people
5|85|so allah rewarded them for what they said with gardens in paradise beneath which rivers flow wherein they abide eternally and that is the reward of doers of good
5|86|but those who disbelieved and denied our signs they are the companions of hellfire
5|87|o you who have believed do not prohibit the good things which allah has made lawful to you and do not transgress indeed allah does not like transgressors
5|88|and eat of what allah has provided for you which is lawful and good and fear allah in whom you are believers
5|89|allah will not impose blame upon you for what is meaningless in your oaths but he will impose blame upon you for breaking what you intended of oaths so its expiation is the feeding of ten needy people from the average of that which you feed your own families or clothing them or the freeing of a slave but whoever cannot find or afford it then a fast of three days is required that is the expiation for oaths when you have sworn but guard your oaths thus does allah make clear to you his verses that you may be grateful
5|90|o you who have believed indeed intoxicants gambling sacrificing on stone alters to other than allah and divining arrows are but defilement from the work of satan so avoid it that you may be successful
5|91|satan only wants to cause between you animosity and hatred through intoxicants and gambling and to avert you from the remembrance of allah and from prayer so will you not desist
5|92|and obey allah and obey the messenger and beware and if you turn away then know that upon our messenger is only the responsibility for clear notification
5|93|there is not upon those who believe and do righteousness any blame concerning what they have eaten in the past if they now fear allah and believe and do righteous deeds and then fear allah and believe and then fear allah and do good and allah loves the doers of good
5|94|o you who have believed allah will surely test you through something of the game that your hands and spears can reach that allah may make evident those who fear him unseen and whoever transgresses after that for him is a painful punishment
5|95|o you who have believed do not kill game while you are in the state of ihram and whoever of you kills it intentionally the penalty is an equivalent from sacrificial animals to what he killed as judged by two just men among you as an offering to allah delivered to the ka bah or an expiation the feeding of needy people or the equivalent of that in fasting that he may taste the consequence of his deed allah has pardoned what is past but whoever returns to violation then allah will take retribution from him and allah is exalted in might and owner of retribution
5|96|lawful to you is game from the sea and its food as provision for you and the travelers but forbidden to you is game from the land as long as you are in the state of ihram and fear allah to whom you will be gathered
5|97|allah has made the ka bah the sacred house standing for the people and has sanctified the sacred months and the sacrificial animals and the garlands by which they are identified that is so you may know that allah knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth and that allah is knowing of all things
5|98|know that allah is severe in penalty and that allah is forgiving and merciful
5|99|not upon the messenger is responsibility except for notification and allah knows whatever you reveal and whatever you conceal
5|100|say not equal are the evil and the good although the abundance of evil might impress you so fear allah o you of understanding that you may be successful
5|101|o you who have believed do not ask about things which if they are shown to you will distress you but if you ask about them while the qur an is being revealed they will be shown to you allah has pardoned that which is past and allah is forgiving and forbearing
5|102|a people asked such questions before you then they became thereby disbelievers
5|103|allah has not appointed such innovations as bahirah or sa ibah or wasilah or ham but those who disbelieve invent falsehood about allah and most of them do not reason
5|104|and when it is said to them come to what allah has revealed and to the messenger they say sufficient for us is that upon which we found our fathers even though their fathers knew nothing nor were they guided
5|105|o you who have believed upon you is responsibility for yourselves those who have gone astray will not harm you when you have been guided to allah is you return all together then he will inform you of what you used to do
5|106|o you who have believed testimony should be taken among you when death approaches one of you at the time of bequest that of two just men from among you or two others from outside if you are traveling through the land and the disaster of death should strike you detain them after the prayer and let them both swear by allah if you doubt their testimony saying we will not exchange our oath for a price even if he should be a near relative and we will not withhold the testimony of allah indeed we would then be of the sinful
5|107|but if it is found that those two were guilty of perjury let two others stand in their place who are foremost in claim from those who have a lawful right and let them swear by allah our testimony is truer than their testimony and we have not transgressed indeed we would then be of the wrongdoers
5|108|that is more likely that they will give testimony according to its true objective or at least they would fear that other oaths might be taken after their oaths and fear allah and listen and allah does not guide the defiantly disobedient people
5|109|be warned of the day when allah will assemble the messengers and say what was the response you received they will say we have no knowledge indeed it is you who is knower of the unseen
5|110|the day when allah will say o jesus son of mary remember my favor upon you and upon your mother when i supported you with the pure spirit and you spoke to the people in the cradle and in maturity and remember when i taught you writing and wisdom and the torah and the gospel and when you designed from clay what was like the form of a bird with my permission then you breathed into it and it became a bird with my permission and you healed the blind and the leper with my permission and when you brought forth the dead with my permission and when i restrained the children of israel from killing you when you came to them with clear proofs and those who disbelieved among them said this is not but obvious magic
5|111|and remember when i inspired to the disciples believe in me and in my messenger jesus they said we have believed so bear witness that indeed we are muslims in submission to allah
5|112|and remember when the disciples said o jesus son of mary can your lord send down to us a table spread with food from the heaven jesus said fear allah if you should be believers
5|113|they said we wish to eat from it and let our hearts be reassured and know that you have been truthful to us and be among its witnesses
5|114|said jesus the son of mary o allah our lord send down to us a table spread with food from the heaven to be for us a festival for the first of us and the last of us and a sign from you and provide for us and you are the best of providers
5|115|allah said indeed i will sent it down to you but whoever disbelieves afterwards from among you then indeed will i punish him with a punishment by which i have not punished anyone among the worlds
5|116|and beware the day when allah will say o jesus son of mary did you say to the people take me and my mother as deities besides allah he will say exalted are you it was not for me to say that to which i have no right if i had said it you would have known it you know what is within myself and i do not know what is within yourself indeed it is you who is knower of the unseen
5|117|i said not to them except what you commanded me to worship allah my lord and your lord and i was a witness over them as long as i was among them but when you took me up you were the observer over them and you are over all things witness
5|118|if you should punish them indeed they are your servants but if you forgive them indeed it is you who is the exalted in might the wise
5|119|allah will say this is the day when the truthful will benefit from their truthfulness for them are gardens in paradise beneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide forever allah being pleased with them and they with him that is the great attainment
5|120|to allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is within them and he is over all things competent
6|1|all praise is due to allah who created the heavens and the earth and made the darkness and the light then those who disbelieve equate others with their lord
6|2|it is he who created you from clay and then decreed a term and a specified time known to him then still you are in dispute
6|3|and he is allah the only deity in the heavens and the earth he knows your secret and what you make public and he knows that which you earn
6|4|and no sign comes to them from the signs of their lord except that they turn away therefrom
6|5|for they had denied the truth when it came to them but there is going to reach them the news of what they used to ridicule
6|6|have they not seen how many generations we destroyed before them which we had established upon the earth as we have not established you and we sent rain from the sky upon them in showers and made rivers flow beneath them then we destroyed them for their sins and brought forth after them a generation of others
6|7|and even if we had sent down to you o muhammad a written scripture on a page and they touched it with their hands the disbelievers would say this is not but obvious magic
6|8|and they say why was there not sent down to him an angel but if we had sent down an angel the matter would have been decided then they would not be reprieved
6|9|and if we had made him an angel we would have made him appear as a man and we would have covered them with that in which they cover themselves
6|10|and already were messengers ridiculed before you but those who mocked them were enveloped by that which they used to ridicule
6|11|say travel through the land then observe how was the end of the deniers
6|12|say to whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and earth say to allah he has decreed upon himself mercy he will surely assemble you for the day of resurrection about which there is no doubt those who will lose themselves that day do not believe
6|13|and to him belongs that which reposes by night and by day and he is the hearing the knowing
6|14|say is it other than allah i should take as a protector creator of the heavens and the earth while it is he who feeds and is not fed say o muhammad indeed i have been commanded to be the first among you who submit to allah and was commanded do not ever be of the polytheists
6|15|say indeed i fear if i should disobey my lord the punishment of a tremendous day
6|16|he from whom it is averted that day allah has granted him mercy and that is the clear attainment
6|17|and if allah should touch you with adversity there is no remover of it except him and if he touches you with good then he is over all things competent
6|18|and he is the subjugator over his servants and he is the wise the acquainted with all
6|19|say what thing is greatest in testimony say allah is witness between me and you and this qur an was revealed to me that i may warn you thereby and whomever it reaches do you truly testify that with allah there are other deities say i will not testify with you say indeed he is but one god and indeed i am free of what you associate with him
6|20|those to whom we have given the scripture recognize it as they recognize their own sons those who will lose themselves in the hereafter do not believe
6|21|and who is more unjust than one who invents about allah a lie or denies his verses indeed the wrongdoers will not succeed
6|22|and mention o muhammad the day we will gather them all together then we will say to those who associated others with allah where are your partners that you used to claim with him
6|23|then there will be no excuse upon examination except they will say by allah our lord we were not those who associated
6|24|see how they will lie about themselves and lost from them will be what they used to invent
6|25|and among them are those who listen to you but we have placed over their hearts coverings lest they understand it and in their ears deafness and if they should see every sign they will not believe in it even when they come to you arguing with you those who disbelieve say this is not but legends of the former peoples
6|26|and they prevent others from him and are themselves remote from him and they do not destroy except themselves but they perceive it not
6|27|if you could but see when they are made to stand before the fire and will say oh would that we could be returned to life on earth and not deny the signs of our lord and be among the believers
6|28|but what they concealed before has now appeared to them and even if they were returned they would return to that which they were forbidden and indeed they are liars
6|29|and they say there is none but our worldly life and we will not be resurrected
6|30|if you could but see when they will be made to stand before their lord he will say is this not the truth they will say yes by our lord he will then say so taste the punishment because you used to disbelieve
6|31|those will have lost who deny the meeting with allah until when the hour of resurrection comes upon them unexpectedly they will say oh how great is our regret over what we neglected concerning it while they bear their burdens on their backs unquestionably evil is that which they bear
6|32|and the worldly life is not but amusement and diversion but the home of the hereafter is best for those who fear allah so will you not reason
6|33|we know that you o muhammad are saddened by what they say and indeed they do not call you untruthful but it is the verses of allah that the wrongdoers reject
6|34|and certainly were messengers denied before you but they were patient over the effects of denial and they were harmed until our victory came to them and none can alter the words of allah and there has certainly come to you some information about the previous messengers
6|35|and if their evasion is difficult for you then if you are able to seek a tunnel into the earth or a stairway into the sky to bring them a sign then do so but if allah had willed he would have united them upon guidance so never be of the ignorant
6|36|only those who hear will respond but the dead allah will resurrect them then to him they will be returned
6|37|and they say why has a sign not been sent down to him from his lord say indeed allah is able to send down a sign but most of them do not know
6|38|and there is no creature on or within the earth or bird that flies with its wings except that they are communities like you we have not neglected in the register a thing then unto their lord they will be gathered
6|39|but those who deny our verses are deaf and dumb within darknesses whomever allah wills he leaves astray and whomever he wills he puts him on a straight path
6|40|say have you considered if there came to you the punishment of allah or there came to you the hour is it other than allah you would invoke if you should be truthful
6|41|no it is him alone you would invoke and he would remove that for which you invoked him if he willed and you would forget what you associate with him
6|42|and we have already sent messengers to nations before you o muhammad then we seized them with poverty and hardship that perhaps they might humble themselves to us
6|43|then why when our punishment came to them did they not humble themselves but their hearts became hardened and satan made attractive to them that which they were doing
6|44|so when they forgot that by which they had been reminded we opened to them the doors of every good thing until when they rejoiced in that which they were given we seized them suddenly and they were then in despair
6|45|so the people that committed wrong were eliminated and praise to allah lord of the worlds
6|46|say have you considered if allah should take away your hearing and your sight and set a seal upon your hearts which deity other than allah could bring them back to you look how we diversify the verses then they still turn away
6|47|say have you considered if the punishment of allah should come to you unexpectedly or manifestly will any be destroyed but the wrongdoing people
6|48|and we send not the messengers except as bringers of good tidings and warners so whoever believes and reforms there will be no fear concerning them nor will they grieve
6|49|but those who deny our verses the punishment will touch them for their defiant disobedience
6|50|say o muhammad i do not tell you that i have the depositories containing the provision of allah or that i know the unseen nor do i tell you that i am an angel i only follow what is revealed to me say is the blind equivalent to the seeing then will you not give thought
6|51|and warn by the qur an those who fear that they will be gathered before their lord for them besides him will be no protector and no intercessor that they might become righteous
6|52|and do not send away those who call upon their lord morning and afternoon seeking his countenance not upon you is anything of their account and not upon them is anything of your account so were you to send them away you would then be of the wrongdoers
6|53|and thus we have tried some of them through others that the disbelievers might say is it these whom allah has favored among us is not allah most knowing of those who are grateful
6|54|and when those come to you who believe in our verses say peace be upon you your lord has decreed upon himself mercy that any of you who does wrong out of ignorance and then repents after that and corrects himself indeed he is forgiving and merciful
6|55|and thus do we detail the verses and thus the way of the criminals will become evident
6|56|say indeed i have been forbidden to worship those you invoke besides allah say i will not follow your desires for i would then have gone astray and i would not be of the rightly guided
6|57|say indeed i am on clear evidence from my lord and you have denied it i do not have that for which you are impatient the decision is only for allah he relates the truth and he is the best of deciders
6|58|say if i had that for which you are impatient the matter would have been decided between me and you but allah is most knowing of the wrongdoers
6|59|and with him are the keys of the unseen none knows them except him and he knows what is on the land and in the sea not a leaf falls but that he knows it and no grain is there within the darknesses of the earth and no moist or dry thing but that it is written in a clear record
6|60|and it is he who takes your souls by night and knows what you have committed by day then he revives you therein that a specified term may be fulfilled then to him will be your return then he will inform you about what you used to do
6|61|and he is the subjugator over his servants and he sends over you guardian angels until when death comes to one of you our messengers take him and they do not fail in their duties
6|62|then they his servants are returned to allah their true lord unquestionably his is the judgement and he is the swiftest of accountants
6|63|say who rescues you from the darknesses of the land and sea when you call upon him imploring aloud and privately if he should save us from this crisis we will surely be among the thankful
6|64|say it is allah who saves you from it and from every distress then you still associate others with him
6|65|say he is the one able to send upon you affliction from above you or from beneath your feet or to confuse you so you become sects and make you taste the violence of one another look how we diversify the signs that they might understand
6|66|but your people have denied it while it is the truth say i am not over you a manager
6|67|for every happening is a finality and you are going to know
6|68|and when you see those who engage in offensive discourse concerning our verses then turn away from them until they enter into another conversation and if satan should cause you to forget then do not remain after the reminder with the wrongdoing people
6|69|and those who fear allah are not held accountable for the disbelievers at all but only for a reminder that perhaps they will fear him
6|70|and leave those who take their religion as amusement and diversion and whom the worldly life has deluded but remind with the qur an lest a soul be given up to destruction for what it earned it will have other than allah no protector and no intercessor and if it should offer every compensation it would not be taken from it those are the ones who are given to destruction for what they have earned for them will be a drink of scalding water and a painful punishment because they used to disbelieve
6|71|say shall we invoke instead of allah that which neither benefits us nor harms us and be turned back on our heels after allah has guided us we would then be like one whom the devils enticed to wander upon the earth confused while he has companions inviting him to guidance calling come to us say indeed the guidance of allah is the only guidance and we have been commanded to submit to the lord of the worlds
6|72|and to establish prayer and fear him and it is he to whom you will be gathered
6|73|and it is he who created the heavens and earth in truth and the day he says be and it is his word is the truth and his is the dominion on the day the horn is blown he is knower of the unseen and the witnessed and he is the wise the acquainted
6|74|and mention o muhammad when abraham said to his father azar do you take idols as deities indeed i see you and your people to be in manifest error
6|75|and thus did we show abraham the realm of the heavens and the earth that he would be among the certain in faith
6|76|so when the night covered him with darkness he saw a star he said this is my lord but when it set he said i like not those that disappear
6|77|and when he saw the moon rising he said this is my lord but when it set he said unless my lord guides me i will surely be among the people gone astray
6|78|and when he saw the sun rising he said this is my lord this is greater but when it set he said o my people indeed i am free from what you associate with allah
6|79|indeed i have turned my face toward he who created the heavens and the earth inclining toward truth and i am not of those who associate others with allah
6|80|and his people argued with him he said do you argue with me concerning allah while he has guided me and i fear not what you associate with him and will not be harmed unless my lord should will something my lord encompasses all things in knowledge then will you not remember
6|81|and how should i fear what you associate while you do not fear that you have associated with allah that for which he has not sent down to you any authority so which of the two parties has more right to security if you should know
6|82|they who believe and do not mix their belief with injustice those will have security and they are rightly guided
6|83|and that was our conclusive argument which we gave abraham against his people we raise by degrees whom we will indeed your lord is wise and knowing
6|84|and we gave to abraham isaac and jacob all of them we guided and noah we guided before and among his descendants david and solomon and job and joseph and moses and aaron thus do we reward the doers of good
6|85|and zechariah and john and jesus and elias and all were of the righteous
6|86|and ishmael and elisha and jonah and lot and all of them we preferred over the worlds
6|87|and some among their fathers and their descendants and their brothers and we chose them and we guided them to a straight path
6|88|that is the guidance of allah by which he guides whomever he wills of his servants but if they had associated others with allah then worthless for them would be whatever they were doing
6|89|those are the ones to whom we gave the scripture and authority and prophethood but if the disbelievers deny it then we have entrusted it to a people who are not therein disbelievers
6|90|those are the ones whom allah has guided so from their guidance take an example say i ask of you for this message no payment it is not but a reminder for the worlds
6|91|and they did not appraise allah with true appraisal when they said allah did not reveal to a human being anything say who revealed the scripture that moses brought as light and guidance to the people you jews make it into pages disclosing some of it and concealing much and you were taught that which you knew not neither you nor your fathers say allah revealed it then leave them in their empty discourse amusing themselves
6|92|and this is a book which we have sent down blessed and confirming what was before it that you may warn the mother of cities and those around it those who believe in the hereafter believe in it and they are maintaining their prayers
6|93|and who is more unjust than one who invents a lie about allah or says it has been inspired to me while nothing has been inspired to him and one who says i will reveal something like what allah revealed and if you could but see when the wrongdoers are in the overwhelming pangs of death while the angels extend their hands saying discharge your souls today you will be awarded the punishment of extreme humiliation for what you used to say against allah other than the truth and that you were toward his verses being arrogant
6|94|it will be said to them and you have certainly come to us alone as we created you the first time and you have left whatever we bestowed upon you behind you and we do not see with you your intercessors which you claimed that they were among you associates of allah it has all been severed between you and lost from you is what you used to claim
6|95|indeed allah is the cleaver of grain and date seeds he brings the living out of the dead and brings the dead out of the living that is allah so how are you deluded
6|96|he is the cleaver of daybreak and has made the night for rest and the sun and moon for calculation that is the determination of the exalted in might the knowing
6|97|and it is he who placed for you the stars that you may be guided by them through the darknesses of the land and sea we have detailed the signs for a people who know
6|98|and it is he who produced you from one soul and gave you a place of dwelling and of storage we have detailed the signs for a people who understand
6|99|and it is he who sends down rain from the sky and we produce thereby the growth of all things we produce from it greenery from which we produce grains arranged in layers and from the palm trees of its emerging fruit are clusters hanging low and we produce gardens of grapevines and olives and pomegranates similar yet varied look at each of its fruit when it yields and at its ripening indeed in that are signs for a people who believe
6|100|but they have attributed to allah partners the jinn while he has created them and have fabricated for him sons and daughters exalted is he and high above what they describe
6|101|he is originator of the heavens and the earth how could he have a son when he does not have a companion and he created all things and he is of all things knowing
6|102|that is allah your lord there is no deity except him the creator of all things so worship him and he is disposer of all things
6|103|vision perceives him not but he perceives all vision and he is the subtle the acquainted
6|104|there has come to you enlightenment from your lord so whoever will see does so for the benefit of his soul and whoever is blind does harm against it and say i am not a guardian over you
6|105|and thus do we diversify the verses so the disbelievers will say you have studied and so we may make the qur an clear for a people who know
6|106|follow o muhammad what has been revealed to you from your lord there is no deity except him and turn away from those who associate others with allah
6|107|but if allah had willed they would not have associated and we have not appointed you over them as a guardian nor are you a manager over them
6|108|and do not insult those they invoke other than allah lest they insult allah in enmity without knowledge thus we have made pleasing to every community their deeds then to their lord is their return and he will inform them about what they used to do
6|109|and they swear by allah their strongest oaths that if a sign came to them they would surely believe in it say the signs are only with allah and what will make you perceive that even if a sign came they would not believe
6|110|and we will turn away their hearts and their eyes just as they refused to believe in it the first time and we will leave them in their transgression wandering blindly
6|111|and even if we had sent down to them the angels with the message and the dead spoke to them of it and we gathered together every created thing in front of them they would not believe unless allah should will but most of them of that are ignorant
6|112|and thus we have made for every prophet an enemy devils from mankind and jinn inspiring to one another decorative speech in delusion but if your lord had willed they would not have done it so leave them and that which they invent
6|113|and it is so the hearts of those who disbelieve in the hereafter will incline toward it and that they will be satisfied with it and that they will commit that which they are committing
6|114|say then is it other than allah i should seek as judge while it is he who has revealed to you the book explained in detail and those to whom we previously gave the scripture know that it is sent down from your lord in truth so never be among the doubters
6|115|and the word of your lord has been fulfilled in truth and in justice none can alter his words and he is the hearing the knowing
6|116|and if you obey most of those upon the earth they will mislead you from the way of allah they follow not except assumption and they are not but falsifying
6|117|indeed your lord is most knowing of who strays from his way and he is most knowing of the rightly guided
6|118|so eat of that meat upon which the name of allah has been mentioned if you are believers in his verses
6|119|and why should you not eat of that upon which the name of allah has been mentioned while he has explained in detail to you what he has forbidden you excepting that to which you are compelled and indeed do many lead others astray through their own inclinations without knowledge indeed your lord he is most knowing of the transgressors
6|120|and leave what is apparent of sin and what is concealed thereof indeed those who earn blame for sin will be recompensed for that which they used to commit
6|121|and do not eat of that upon which the name of allah has not been mentioned for indeed it is grave disobedience and indeed do the devils inspire their allies among men to dispute with you and if you were to obey them indeed you would be associators of others with him
6|122|and is one who was dead and we gave him life and made for him light by which to walk among the people like one who is in darkness never to emerge therefrom thus it has been made pleasing to the disbelievers that which they were doing
6|123|and thus we have placed within every city the greatest of its criminals to conspire therein but they conspire not except against themselves and they perceive it not
6|124|and when a sign comes to them they say never will we believe until we are given like that which was given to the messengers of allah allah is most knowing of where he places his message there will afflict those who committed crimes debasement before allah and severe punishment for what they used to conspire
6|125|so whoever allah wants to guide he expands his breast to contain islam and whoever he wants to misguide he makes his breast tight and constricted as though he were climbing into the sky thus does allah place defilement upon those who do not believe
6|126|and this is the path of your lord leading straight we have detailed the verses for a people who remember
6|127|for them will be the home of peace with their lord and he will be their protecting friend because of what they used to do
6|128|and mention o muhammad the day when he will gather them together and say o company of jinn you have misled many of mankind and their allies among mankind will say our lord some of us made use of others and we have now reached our term which you appointed for us he will say the fire is your residence wherein you will abide eternally except for what allah wills indeed your lord is wise and knowing
6|129|and thus will we make some of the wrongdoers allies of others for what they used to earn
6|130|o company of jinn and mankind did there not come to you messengers from among you relating to you my verses and warning you of the meeting of this day of yours they will say we bear witness against ourselves and the worldly life had deluded them and they will bear witness against themselves that they were disbelievers
6|131|that is because your lord would not destroy the cities for wrongdoing while their people were unaware
6|132|and for all are degrees from what they have done and your lord is not unaware of what they do
6|133|and your lord is the free of need the possessor of mercy if he wills he can do away with you and give succession after you to whomever he wills just as he produced you from the descendants of another people
6|134|indeed what you are promised is coming and you will not cause failure to allah
6|135|say o my people work according to your position for indeed i am working and you are going to know who will have succession in the home indeed the wrongdoers will not succeed
6|136|and the polytheists assign to allah from that which he created of crops and livestock a share and say this is for allah by their claim and this is for our partners associated with him but what is for their partners does not reach allah while what is for allah this reaches their partners evil is that which they rule
6|137|and likewise to many of the polytheists their partners have made to seem pleasing the killing of their children in order to bring about their destruction and to cover them with confusion in their religion and if allah had willed they would not have done so so leave them and that which they invent
6|138|and they say these animals and crops are forbidden no one may eat from them except whom we will by their claim and there are those camels whose backs are forbidden by them and those upon which the name of allah is not mentioned all of this an invention of untruth about him he will punish them for what they were inventing
6|139|and they say what is in the bellies of these animals is exclusively for our males and forbidden to our females but if it is born dead then all of them have shares therein he will punish them for their description indeed he is wise and knowing
6|140|those will have lost who killed their children in foolishness without knowledge and prohibited what allah had provided for them inventing untruth about allah they have gone astray and were not rightly guided
6|141|and he it is who causes gardens to grow both trellised and untrellised and palm trees and crops of different kinds of food and olives and pomegranates similar and dissimilar eat of each of its fruit when it yields and give its due zakah on the day of its harvest and be not excessive indeed he does not like those who commit excess
6|142|and of the grazing livestock are carriers of burdens and those too small eat of what allah has provided for you and do not follow the footsteps of satan indeed he is to you a clear enemy
6|143|they are eight mates of the sheep two and of the goats two say is it the two males he has forbidden or the two females or that which the wombs of the two females contain inform me with knowledge if you should be truthful
6|144|and of the camels two and of the cattle two say is it the two males he has forbidden or the two females or that which the wombs of the two females contain or were you witnesses when allah charged you with this then who is more unjust than one who invents a lie about allah to mislead the people by something other than knowledge indeed allah does not guide the wrongdoing people
6|145|say i do not find within that which was revealed to me anything forbidden to one who would eat it unless it be a dead animal or blood spilled out or the flesh of swine for indeed it is impure or it be that slaughtered in disobedience dedicated to other than allah but whoever is forced by necessity neither desiring it nor transgressing its limit then indeed your lord is forgiving and merciful
6|146|and to those who are jews we prohibited every animal of uncloven hoof and of the cattle and the sheep we prohibited to them their fat except what adheres to their backs or the entrails or what is joined with bone by that we repaid them for their injustice and indeed we are truthful
6|147|so if they deny you o muhammad say your lord is the possessor of vast mercy but his punishment cannot be repelled from the people who are criminals
6|148|those who associated with allah will say if allah had willed we would not have associated anything and neither would our fathers nor would we have prohibited anything likewise did those before deny until they tasted our punishment say do you have any knowledge that you can produce for us you follow not except assumption and you are not but falsifying
6|149|say with allah is the far reaching argument if he had willed he would have guided you all
6|150|say o muhammad bring forward your witnesses who will testify that allah has prohibited this and if they testify do not testify with them and do not follow the desires of those who deny our verses and those who do not believe in the hereafter while they equate others with their lord
6|151|say come i will recite what your lord has prohibited to you he commands that you not associate anything with him and to parents good treatment and do not kill your children out of poverty we will provide for you and them and do not approach immoralities what is apparent of them and what is concealed and do not kill the soul which allah has forbidden to be killed except by legal right this has he instructed you that you may use reason
6|152|and do not approach the orphan s property except in a way that is best until he reaches maturity and give full measure and weight in justice we do not charge any soul except with that within its capacity and when you testify be just even if it concerns a near relative and the covenant of allah fulfill this has he instructed you that you may remember
6|153|and moreover this is my path which is straight so follow it and do not follow other ways for you will be separated from his way this has he instructed you that you may become righteous
6|154|then we gave moses the scripture making complete our favor upon the one who did good and as a detailed explanation of all things and as guidance and mercy that perhaps in the matter of the meeting with their lord they would believe
6|155|and this qur an is a book we have revealed which is blessed so follow it and fear allah that you may receive mercy
6|156|we revealed it lest you say the scripture was only sent down to two groups before us but we were of their study unaware
6|157|or lest you say if only the scripture had been revealed to us we would have been better guided than they so there has now come to you a clear evidence from your lord and a guidance and mercy then who is more unjust than one who denies the verses of allah and turns away from them we will recompense those who turn away from our verses with the worst of punishment for their having turned away
6|158|do they then wait for anything except that the angels should come to them or your lord should come or that there come some of the signs of your lord the day that some of the signs of your lord will come no soul will benefit from its faith as long as it had not believed before or had earned through its faith some good say wait indeed we also are waiting
6|159|indeed those who have divided their religion and become sects you o muhammad are not associated with them in anything their affair is only left to allah then he will inform them about what they used to do
6|160|whoever comes on the day of judgement with a good deed will have ten times the like thereof to his credit and whoever comes with an evil deed will not be recompensed except the like thereof and they will not be wronged
6|161|say indeed my lord has guided me to a straight path a correct religion the way of abraham inclining toward truth and he was not among those who associated others with allah
6|162|say indeed my prayer my rites of sacrifice my living and my dying are for allah lord of the worlds
6|163|no partner has he and this i have been commanded and i am the first among you of the muslims
6|164|say is it other than allah i should desire as a lord while he is the lord of all things and every soul earns not blame except against itself and no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another then to your lord is your return and he will inform you concerning that over which you used to differ
6|165|and it is he who has made you successors upon the earth and has raised some of you above others in degrees of rank that he may try you through what he has given you indeed your lord is swift in penalty but indeed he is forgiving and merciful
7|1|alif lam meem sad
7|2|this is a book revealed to you o muhammad so let there not be in your breast distress therefrom that you may warn thereby and as a reminder to the believers
7|3|follow o mankind what has been revealed to you from your lord and do not follow other than him any allies little do you remember
7|4|and how many cities have we destroyed and our punishment came to them at night or while they were sleeping at noon
7|5|and their declaration when our punishment came to them was only that they said indeed we were wrongdoers
7|6|then we will surely question those to whom a message was sent and we will surely question the messengers
7|7|then we will surely relate their deeds to them with knowledge and we were not at all absent
7|8|and the weighing of deeds that day will be the truth so those whose scales are heavy it is they who will be the successful
7|9|and those whose scales are light they are the ones who will lose themselves for what injustice they were doing toward our verses
7|10|and we have certainly established you upon the earth and made for you therein ways of livelihood little are you grateful
7|11|and we have certainly created you o mankind and given you human form then we said to the angels prostrate to adam so they prostrated except for iblees he was not of those who prostrated
7|12|allah said what prevented you from prostrating when i commanded you satan said i am better than him you created me from fire and created him from clay
7|13|allah said descend from paradise for it is not for you to be arrogant therein so get out indeed you are of the debased
7|14|satan said reprieve me until the day they are resurrected
7|15|allah said indeed you are of those reprieved
7|16|satan said because you have put me in error i will surely sit in wait for them on your straight path
7|17|then i will come to them from before them and from behind them and on their right and on their left and you will not find most of them grateful to you
7|18|allah said get out of paradise reproached and expelled whoever follows you among them i will surely fill hell with you all together
7|19|and o adam dwell you and your wife in paradise and eat from wherever you will but do not approach this tree lest you be among the wrongdoers
7|20|but satan whispered to them to make apparent to them that which was concealed from them of their private parts he said your lord did not forbid you this tree except that you become angels or become of the immortal
7|21|and he swore by allah to them indeed i am to you from among the sincere advisors
7|22|so he made them fall through deception and when they tasted of the tree their private parts became apparent to them and they began to fasten together over themselves from the leaves of paradise and their lord called to them did i not forbid you from that tree and tell you that satan is to you a clear enemy
7|23|they said our lord we have wronged ourselves and if you do not forgive us and have mercy upon us we will surely be among the losers
7|24|allah said descend being to one another enemies and for you on the earth is a place of settlement and enjoyment for a time
7|25|he said therein you will live and therein you will die and from it you will be brought forth
7|26|o children of adam we have bestowed upon you clothing to conceal your private parts and as adornment but the clothing of righteousness that is best that is from the signs of allah that perhaps they will remember
7|27|o children of adam let not satan tempt you as he removed your parents from paradise stripping them of their clothing to show them their private parts indeed he sees you he and his tribe from where you do not see them indeed we have made the devils allies to those who do not believe
7|28|and when they commit an immorality they say we found our fathers doing it and allah has ordered us to do it say indeed allah does not order immorality do you say about allah that which you do not know
7|29|say o muhammad my lord has ordered justice and that you maintain yourselves in worship of him at every place or time of prostration and invoke him sincere to him in religion just as he originated you you will return to life
7|30|a group of you he guided and a group deserved to be in error indeed they had taken the devils as allies instead of allah while they thought that they were guided
7|31|o children of adam take your adornment at every masjid and eat and drink but be not excessive indeed he likes not those who commit excess
7|32|say who has forbidden the adornment of allah which he has produced for his servants and the good lawful things of provision say they are for those who believe during the worldly life but exclusively for them on the day of resurrection thus do we detail the verses for a people who know
7|33|say my lord has only forbidden immoralities what is apparent of them and what is concealed and sin and oppression without right and that you associate with allah that for which he has not sent down authority and that you say about allah that which you do not know
7|34|and for every nation is a specified term so when their time has come they will not remain behind an hour nor will they precede it
7|35|o children of adam if there come to you messengers from among you relating to you my verses then whoever fears allah and reforms there will be no fear concerning them nor will they grieve
7|36|but the ones who deny our verses and are arrogant toward them those are the companions of the fire they will abide therein eternally
7|37|and who is more unjust than one who invents about allah a lie or denies his verses those will attain their portion of the decree until when our messengers come to them to take them in death they will say where are those you used to invoke besides allah they will say they have departed from us and will bear witness against themselves that they were disbelievers
7|38|allah will say enter among nations which had passed on before you of jinn and mankind into the fire every time a nation enters it will curse its sister until when they have all overtaken one another therein the last of them will say about the first of them our lord these had misled us so give them a double punishment of the fire he will say for each is double but you do not know
7|39|and the first of them will say to the last of them then you had not any favor over us so taste the punishment for what you used to earn
7|40|indeed those who deny our verses and are arrogant toward them the gates of heaven will not be opened for them nor will they enter paradise until a camel enters into the eye of a needle and thus do we recompense the criminals
7|41|they will have from hell a bed and over them coverings of fire and thus do we recompense the wrongdoers
7|42|but those who believed and did righteous deeds we charge no soul except within its capacity those are the companions of paradise they will abide therein eternally
7|43|and we will have removed whatever is within their breasts of resentment while flowing beneath them are rivers and they will say praise to allah who has guided us to this and we would never have been guided if allah had not guided us certainly the messengers of our lord had come with the truth and they will be called this is paradise which you have been made to inherit for what you used to do
7|44|and the companions of paradise will call out to the companions of the fire we have already found what our lord promised us to be true have you found what your lord promised to be true they will say yes then an announcer will announce among them the curse of allah shall be upon the wrongdoers
7|45|who averted people from the way of allah and sought to make it seem deviant while they were concerning the hereafter disbelievers
7|46|and between them will be a partition and on its elevations are men who recognize all by their mark and they call out to the companions of paradise peace be upon you they have not yet entered it but they long intensely
7|47|and when their eyes are turned toward the companions of the fire they say our lord do not place us with the wrongdoing people
7|48|and the companions of the elevations will call to men within hell whom they recognize by their mark saying of no avail to you was your gathering and the fact that you were arrogant
7|49|allah will say are these the ones whom you inhabitants of hell swore that allah would never offer them mercy enter paradise o people of the elevations no fear will there be concerning you nor will you grieve
7|50|and the companions of the fire will call to the companions of paradise pour upon us some water or from whatever allah has provided you they will say indeed allah has forbidden them both to the disbelievers
7|51|who took their religion as distraction and amusement and whom the worldly life deluded so today we will forget them just as they forgot the meeting of this day of theirs and for having rejected our verses
7|52|and we had certainly brought them a book which we detailed by knowledge as guidance and mercy to a people who believe
7|53|do they await except its result the day its result comes those who had ignored it before will say the messengers of our lord had come with the truth so are there now any intercessors to intercede for us or could we be sent back to do other than we used to do they will have lost themselves and lost from them is what they used to invent
7|54|indeed your lord is allah who created the heavens and earth in six days and then established himself above the throne he covers the night with the day another night chasing it rapidly and he created the sun the moon and the stars subjected by his command unquestionably his is the creation and the command blessed is allah lord of the worlds
7|55|call upon your lord in humility and privately indeed he does not like transgressors
7|56|and cause not corruption upon the earth after its reformation and invoke him in fear and aspiration indeed the mercy of allah is near to the doers of good
7|57|and it is he who sends the winds as good tidings before his mercy until when they have carried heavy rainclouds we drive them to a dead land and we send down rain therein and bring forth thereby some of all the fruits thus will we bring forth the dead perhaps you may be reminded
7|58|and the good land its vegetation emerges by permission of its lord but that which is bad nothing emerges except sparsely with difficulty thus do we diversify the signs for a people who are grateful
7|59|we had certainly sent noah to his people and he said o my people worship allah you have no deity other than him indeed i fear for you the punishment of a tremendous day
7|60|said the eminent among his people indeed we see you in clear error
7|61|noah said o my people there is not error in me but i am a messenger from the lord of the worlds
7|62|i convey to you the messages of my lord and advise you and i know from allah what you do not know
7|63|then do you wonder that there has come to you a reminder from your lord through a man from among you that he may warn you and that you may fear allah so you might receive mercy
7|64|but they denied him so we saved him and those who were with him in the ship and we drowned those who denied our signs indeed they were a blind people
7|65|and to the aad we sent their brother hud he said o my people worship allah you have no deity other than him then will you not fear him
7|66|said the eminent ones who disbelieved among his people indeed we see you in foolishness and indeed we think you are of the liars
7|67|hud said o my people there is not foolishness in me but i am a messenger from the lord of the worlds
7|68|i convey to you the messages of my lord and i am to you a trustworthy adviser
7|69|then do you wonder that there has come to you a reminder from your lord through a man from among you that he may warn you and remember when he made you successors after the people of noah and increased you in stature extensively so remember the favors of allah that you might succeed
7|70|they said have you come to us that we should worship allah alone and leave what our fathers have worshipped then bring us what you promise us if you should be of the truthful
7|71|hud said already have defilement and anger fallen upon you from your lord do you dispute with me concerning mere names you have named them you and your fathers for which allah has not sent down any authority then wait indeed i am with you among those who wait
7|72|so we saved him and those with him by mercy from us and we eliminated those who denied our signs and they were not at all believers
7|73|and to the thamud we sent their brother salih he said o my people worship allah you have no deity other than him there has come to you clear evidence from your lord this is the she camel of allah sent to you as a sign so leave her to eat within allah s land and do not touch her with harm lest there seize you a painful punishment
7|74|and remember when he made you successors after the aad and settled you in the land and you take for yourselves palaces from its plains and carve from the mountains homes then remember the favors of allah and do not commit abuse on the earth spreading corruption
7|75|said the eminent ones who were arrogant among his people to those who were oppressed to those who believed among them do you actually know that salih is sent from his lord they said indeed we in that with which he was sent are believers
7|76|said those who were arrogant indeed we in that which you have believed are disbelievers
7|77|so they hamstrung the she camel and were insolent toward the command of their lord and said o salih bring us what you promise us if you should be of the messengers
7|78|so the earthquake seized them and they became within their home corpses fallen prone
7|79|and he turned away from them and said o my people i had certainly conveyed to you the message of my lord and advised you but you do not like advisors
7|80|and we had sent lot when he said to his people do you commit such immorality as no one has preceded you with from among the worlds
7|81|indeed you approach men with desire instead of women rather you are a transgressing people
7|82|but the answer of his people was only that they said evict them from your city indeed they are men who keep themselves pure
7|83|so we saved him and his family except for his wife she was of those who remained with the evildoers
7|84|and we rained upon them a rain of stones then see how was the end of the criminals
7|85|and to the people of madyan we sent their brother shu ayb he said o my people worship allah you have no deity other than him there has come to you clear evidence from your lord so fulfill the measure and weight and do not deprive people of their due and cause not corruption upon the earth after its reformation that is better for you if you should be believers
7|86|and do not sit on every path threatening and averting from the way of allah those who believe in him seeking to make it seem deviant and remember when you were few and he increased you and see how was the end of the corrupters
7|87|and if there should be a group among you who has believed in that with which i have been sent and a group that has not believed then be patient until allah judges between us and he is the best of judges
7|88|said the eminent ones who were arrogant among his people we will surely evict you o shu ayb and those who have believed with you from our city or you must return to our religion he said even if we were unwilling
7|89|we would have invented against allah a lie if we returned to your religion after allah had saved us from it and it is not for us to return to it except that allah our lord should will our lord has encompassed all things in knowledge upon allah we have relied our lord decide between us and our people in truth and you are the best of those who give decision
7|90|said the eminent ones who disbelieved among his people if you should follow shu ayb indeed you would then be losers
7|91|so the earthquake seized them and they became within their home corpses fallen prone
7|92|those who denied shu ayb it was as though they had never resided there those who denied shu ayb it was they who were the losers
7|93|and he turned away from them and said o my people i had certainly conveyed to you the messages of my lord and advised you so how could i grieve for a disbelieving people
7|94|and we sent to no city a prophet who was denied except that we seized its people with poverty and hardship that they might humble themselves to allah
7|95|then we exchanged in place of the bad condition good until they increased and prospered and said our fathers also were touched with hardship and ease so we seized them suddenly while they did not perceive
7|96|and if only the people of the cities had believed and feared allah we would have opened upon them blessings from the heaven and the earth but they denied the messengers so we seized them for what they were earning
7|97|then did the people of the cities feel secure from our punishment coming to them at night while they were asleep
7|98|or did the people of the cities feel secure from our punishment coming to them in the morning while they were at play
7|99|then did they feel secure from the plan of allah but no one feels secure from the plan of allah except the losing people
7|100|has it not become clear to those who inherited the earth after its previous people that if we willed we could afflict them for their sins but we seal over their hearts so they do not hear
7|101|those cities we relate to you o muhammad some of their news and certainly did their messengers come to them with clear proofs but they were not to believe in that which they had denied before thus does allah seal over the hearts of the disbelievers
7|102|and we did not find for most of them any covenant but indeed we found most of them defiantly disobedient
7|103|then we sent after them moses with our signs to pharaoh and his establishment but they were unjust toward them so see how was the end of the corrupters
7|104|and moses said o pharaoh i am a messenger from the lord of the worlds
7|105|who is obligated not to say about allah except the truth i have come to you with clear evidence from your lord so send with me the children of israel
7|106|pharaoh said if you have come with a sign then bring it forth if you should be of the truthful
7|107|so moses threw his staff and suddenly it was a serpent manifest
7|108|and he drew out his hand thereupon it was white with radiance for the observers
7|109|said the eminent among the people of pharaoh indeed this is a learned magician
7|110|who wants to expel you from your land through magic so what do you instruct
7|111|they said postpone the matter of him and his brother and send among the cities gatherers
7|112|who will bring you every learned magician
7|113|and the magicians came to pharaoh they said indeed for us is a reward if we are the predominant
7|114|he said yes and moreover you will be among those made near to me
7|115|they said o moses either you throw your staff or we will be the ones to throw first
7|116|he said throw and when they threw they bewitched the eyes of the people and struck terror into them and they presented a great feat of magic
7|117|and we inspired to moses throw your staff and at once it devoured what they were falsifying
7|118|so the truth was established and abolished was what they were doing
7|119|and pharaoh and his people were overcome right there and became debased
7|120|and the magicians fell down in prostration to allah
7|121|they said we have believed in the lord of the worlds
7|122|the lord of moses and aaron
7|123|said pharaoh you believed in him before i gave you permission indeed this is a conspiracy which you conspired in the city to expel therefrom its people but you are going to know
7|124|i will surely cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides then i will surely crucify you all
7|125|they said indeed to our lord we will return
7|126|and you do not resent us except because we believed in the signs of our lord when they came to us our lord pour upon us patience and let us die as muslims in submission to you
7|127|and the eminent among the people of pharaoh said will you leave moses and his people to cause corruption in the land and abandon you and your gods pharaoh said we will kill their sons and keep their women alive and indeed we are subjugators over them
7|128|said moses to his people seek help through allah and be patient indeed the earth belongs to allah he causes to inherit it whom he wills of his servants and the best outcome is for the righteous
7|129|they said we have been harmed before you came to us and after you have come to us he said perhaps your lord will destroy your enemy and grant you succession in the land and see how you will do
7|130|and we certainly seized the people of pharaoh with years of famine and a deficiency in fruits that perhaps they would be reminded
7|131|but when good came to them they said this is ours by right and if a bad condition struck them they saw an evil omen in moses and those with him unquestionably their fortune is with allah but most of them do not know
7|132|and they said no matter what sign you bring us with which to bewitch us we will not be believers in you
7|133|so we sent upon them the flood and locusts and lice and frogs and blood as distinct signs but they were arrogant and were a criminal people
7|134|and when the punishment descended upon them they said o moses invoke for us your lord by what he has promised you if you can remove the punishment from us we will surely believe you and we will send with you the children of israel
7|135|but when we removed the punishment from them until a term which they were to reach then at once they broke their word
7|136|so we took retribution from them and we drowned them in the sea because they denied our signs and were heedless of them
7|137|and we caused the people who had been oppressed to inherit the eastern regions of the land and the western ones which we had blessed and the good word of your lord was fulfilled for the children of israel because of what they had patiently endured and we destroyed all that pharaoh and his people were producing and what they had been building
7|138|and we took the children of israel across the sea then they came upon a people intent in devotion to some idols of theirs they said o moses make for us a god just as they have gods he said indeed you are a people behaving ignorantly
7|139|indeed those worshippers destroyed is that in which they are engaged and worthless is whatever they were doing
7|140|he said is it other than allah i should desire for you as a god while he has preferred you over the worlds
7|141|and recall o children of israel when we saved you from the people of pharaoh who were afflicting you with the worst torment killing your sons and keeping your women alive and in that was a great trial from your lord
7|142|and we made an appointment with moses for thirty nights and perfected them by the addition of ten so the term of his lord was completed as forty nights and moses said to his brother aaron take my place among my people do right by them and do not follow the way of the corrupters
7|143|and when moses arrived at our appointed time and his lord spoke to him he said my lord show me yourself that i may look at you allah said you will not see me but look at the mountain if it should remain in place then you will see me but when his lord appeared to the mountain he rendered it level and moses fell unconscious and when he awoke he said exalted are you i have repented to you and i am the first of the believers
7|144|allah said o moses i have chosen you over the people with my messages and my words to you so take what i have given you and be among the grateful
7|145|and we wrote for him on the tablets something of all things instruction and explanation for all things saying take them with determination and order your people to take the best of it i will show you the home of the defiantly disobedient
7|146|i will turn away from my signs those who are arrogant upon the earth without right and if they should see every sign they will not believe in it and if they see the way of consciousness they will not adopt it as a way but if they see the way of error they will adopt it as a way that is because they have denied our signs and they were heedless of them
7|147|those who denied our signs and the meeting of the hereafter their deeds have become worthless are they recompensed except for what they used to do
7|148|and the people of moses made after his departure from their ornaments a calf an image having a lowing sound did they not see that it could neither speak to them nor guide them to a way they took it for worship and they were wrongdoers
7|149|and when regret overcame them and they saw that they had gone astray they said if our lord does not have mercy upon us and forgive us we will surely be among the losers
7|150|and when moses returned to his people angry and grieved he said how wretched is that by which you have replaced me after my departure were you impatient over the matter of your lord and he threw down the tablets and seized his brother by the hair of his head pulling him toward him aaron said o son of my mother indeed the people oppressed me and were about to kill me so let not the enemies rejoice over me and do not place me among the wrongdoing people
7|151|moses said my lord forgive me and my brother and admit us into your mercy for you are the most merciful of the merciful
7|152|indeed those who took the calf for worship will obtain anger from their lord and humiliation in the life of this world and thus do we recompense the inventors of falsehood
7|153|but those who committed misdeeds and then repented after them and believed indeed your lord thereafter is forgiving and merciful
7|154|and when the anger subsided in moses he took up the tablets and in their inscription was guidance and mercy for those who are fearful of their lord
7|155|and moses chose from his people seventy men for our appointment and when the earthquake seized them he said my lord if you had willed you could have destroyed them before and me as well would you destroy us for what the foolish among us have done this is not but your trial by which you send astray whom you will and guide whom you will you are our protector so forgive us and have mercy upon us and you are the best of forgivers
7|156|and decree for us in this world that which is good and also in the hereafter indeed we have turned back to you allah said my punishment i afflict with it whom i will but my mercy encompasses all things so i will decree it especially for those who fear me and give zakah and those who believe in our verses
7|157|those who follow the messenger the unlettered prophet whom they find written in what they have of the torah and the gospel who enjoins upon them what is right and forbids them what is wrong and makes lawful for them the good things and prohibits for them the evil and relieves them of their burden and the shackles which were upon them so they who have believed in him honored him supported him and followed the light which was sent down with him it is those who will be the successful
7|158|say o muhammad o mankind indeed i am the messenger of allah to you all from him to whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth there is no deity except him he gives life and causes death so believe in allah and his messenger the unlettered prophet who believes in allah and his words and follow him that you may be guided
7|159|and among the people of moses is a community which guides by truth and by it establishes justice
7|160|and we divided them into twelve descendant tribes as distinct nations and we inspired to moses when his people implored him for water strike with your staff the stone and there gushed forth from it twelve springs every people knew its watering place and we shaded them with clouds and sent down upon them manna and quails saying eat from the good things with which we have provided you and they wronged us not but they were only wronging themselves
7|161|and mention o muhammad when it was said to them dwell in this city and eat from it wherever you will and say relieve us of our burdens and enter the gate bowing humbly we will then forgive you your sins we will increase the doers of good in goodness and reward
7|162|but those who wronged among them changed the words to a statement other than that which had been said to them so we sent upon them a punishment from the sky for the wrong that they were doing
7|163|and ask them about the town that was by the sea when they transgressed in the matter of the sabbath when their fish came to them openly on their sabbath day and the day they had no sabbath they did not come to them thus did we give them trial because they were defiantly disobedient
7|164|and when a community among them said why do you advise or warn a people whom allah is about to destroy or to punish with a severe punishment they the advisors said to be absolved before your lord and perhaps they may fear him
7|165|and when they forgot that by which they had been reminded we saved those who had forbidden evil and seized those who wronged with a wretched punishment because they were defiantly disobeying
7|166|so when they were insolent about that which they had been forbidden we said to them be apes despised
7|167|and mention when your lord declared that he would surely continue to send upon them until the day of resurrection those who would afflict them with the worst torment indeed your lord is swift in penalty but indeed he is forgiving and merciful
7|168|and we divided them throughout the earth into nations of them some were righteous and of them some were otherwise and we tested them with good times and bad that perhaps they would return to obedience
7|169|and there followed them successors who inherited the scripture while taking the commodities of this lower life and saying it will be forgiven for us and if an offer like it comes to them they will again take it was not the covenant of the scripture taken from them that they would not say about allah except the truth and they studied what was in it and the home of the hereafter is better for those who fear allah so will you not use reason
7|170|but those who hold fast to the book and establish prayer indeed we will not allow to be lost the reward of the reformers
7|171|and mention when we raised the mountain above them as if it was a dark cloud and they were certain that it would fall upon them and allah said take what we have given you with determination and remember what is in it that you might fear allah
7|172|and mention when your lord took from the children of adam from their loins their descendants and made them testify of themselves saying to them am i not your lord they said yes we have testified this lest you should say on the day of resurrection indeed we were of this unaware
7|173|or lest you say it was only that our fathers associated others in worship with allah before and we were but descendants after them then would you destroy us for what the falsifiers have done
7|174|and thus do we explain in detail the verses and perhaps they will return
7|175|and recite to them o muhammad the news of him to whom we gave knowledge of our signs but he detached himself from them so satan pursued him and he became of the deviators
7|176|and if we had willed we could have elevated him thereby but he adhered instead to the earth and followed his own desire so his example is like that of the dog if you chase him he pants or if you leave him he still pants that is the example of the people who denied our signs so relate the stories that perhaps they will give thought
7|177|how evil an example is that of the people who denied our signs and used to wrong themselves
7|178|whoever allah guides he is the rightly guided and whoever he sends astray it is those who are the losers
7|179|and we have certainly created for hell many of the jinn and mankind they have hearts with which they do not understand they have eyes with which they do not see and they have ears with which they do not hear those are like livestock rather they are more astray it is they who are the heedless
7|180|and to allah belong the best names so invoke him by them and leave the company of those who practice deviation concerning his names they will be recompensed for what they have been doing
7|181|and among those we created is a community which guides by truth and thereby establishes justice
7|182|but those who deny our signs we will progressively lead them to destruction from where they do not know
7|183|and i will give them time indeed my plan is firm
7|184|then do they not give thought there is in their companion muhammad no madness he is not but a clear warner
7|185|do they not look into the realm of the heavens and the earth and everything that allah has created and think that perhaps their appointed time has come near so in what statement hereafter will they believe
7|186|whoever allah sends astray there is no guide for him and he leaves them in their transgression wandering blindly
7|187|they ask you o muhammad about the hour when is its arrival say its knowledge is only with my lord none will reveal its time except him it lays heavily upon the heavens and the earth it will not come upon you except unexpectedly they ask you as if you are familiar with it say its knowledge is only with allah but most of the people do not know
7|188|say i hold not for myself the power of benefit or harm except what allah has willed and if i knew the unseen i could have acquired much wealth and no harm would have touched me i am not except a warner and a bringer of good tidings to a people who believe
7|189|it is he who created you from one soul and created from it its mate that he might dwell in security with her and when he covers her she carries a light burden and continues therein and when it becomes heavy they both invoke allah their lord if you should give us a good child we will surely be among the grateful
7|190|but when he gives them a good child they ascribe partners to him concerning that which he has given them exalted is allah above what they associate with him
7|191|do they associate with him those who create nothing and they are themselves created
7|192|and the false deities are unable to give them help nor can they help themselves
7|193|and if you believers invite them to guidance they will not follow you it is all the same for you whether you invite them or you are silent
7|194|indeed those you polytheists call upon besides allah are servants like you so call upon them and let them respond to you if you should be truthful
7|195|do they have feet by which they walk or do they have hands by which they strike or do they have eyes by which they see or do they have ears by which they hear say o muhammad call your partners and then conspire against me and give me no respite
7|196|indeed my protector is allah who has sent down the book and he is an ally to the righteous
7|197|and those you call upon besides him are unable to help you nor can they help themselves
7|198|and if you invite them to guidance they do not hear and you see them looking at you while they do not see
7|199|take what is given freely enjoin what is good and turn away from the ignorant
7|200|and if an evil suggestion comes to you from satan then seek refuge in allah indeed he is hearing and knowing
7|201|indeed those who fear allah when an impulse touches them from satan they remember him and at once they have insight
7|202|but their brothers the devils increase them in error then they do not stop short
7|203|and when you o muhammad do not bring them a sign they say why have you not contrived it say i only follow what is revealed to me from my lord this qur an is enlightenment from your lord and guidance and mercy for a people who believe
7|204|so when the qur an is recited then listen to it and pay attention that you may receive mercy
7|205|and remember your lord within yourself in humility and in fear without being apparent in speech in the mornings and the evenings and do not be among the heedless
7|206|indeed those who are near your lord are not prevented by arrogance from his worship and they exalt him and to him they prostrate
8|1|they ask you o muhammad about the bounties of war say the decision concerning bounties is for allah and the messenger so fear allah and amend that which is between you and obey allah and his messenger if you should be believers
8|2|the believers are only those who when allah is mentioned their hearts become fearful and when his verses are recited to them it increases them in faith and upon their lord they rely
8|3|the ones who establish prayer and from what we have provided them they spend
8|4|those are the believers truly for them are degrees of high position with their lord and forgiveness and noble provision
8|5|it is just as when your lord brought you out of your home for the battle of badr in truth while indeed a party among the believers were unwilling
8|6|arguing with you concerning the truth after it had become clear as if they were being driven toward death while they were looking on
8|7|remember o believers when allah promised you one of the two groups that it would be yours and you wished that the unarmed one would be yours but allah intended to establish the truth by his words and to eliminate the disbelievers
8|8|that he should establish the truth and abolish falsehood even if the criminals disliked it
8|9|remember when you asked help of your lord and he answered you indeed i will reinforce you with a thousand from the angels following one another
8|10|and allah made it not but good tidings and so that your hearts would be assured thereby and victory is not but from allah indeed allah is exalted in might and wise
8|11|remember when he overwhelmed you with drowsiness giving security from him and sent down upon you from the sky rain by which to purify you and remove from you the evil suggestions of satan and to make steadfast your hearts and plant firmly thereby your feet
8|12|remember when your lord inspired to the angels i am with you so strengthen those who have believed i will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieved so strike them upon the necks and strike from them every fingertip
8|13|that is because they opposed allah and his messenger and whoever opposes allah and his messenger indeed allah is severe in penalty
8|14|that is yours so taste it and indeed for the disbelievers is the punishment of the fire
8|15|o you who have believed when you meet those who disbelieve advancing for battle do not turn to them your backs in flight
8|16|and whoever turns his back to them on such a day unless swerving as a strategy for war or joining another company has certainly returned with anger upon him from allah and his refuge is hell and wretched is the destination
8|17|and you did not kill them but it was allah who killed them and you threw not o muhammad when you threw but it was allah who threw that he might test the believers with a good test indeed allah is hearing and knowing
8|18|that is so and also that allah will weaken the plot of the disbelievers
8|19|if you disbelievers seek the victory the defeat has come to you and if you desist from hostilities it is best for you but if you return to war we will return and never will you be availed by your large company at all even if it should increase and that is because allah is with the believers
8|20|o you who have believed obey allah and his messenger and do not turn from him while you hear his order
8|21|and do not be like those who say we have heard while they do not hear
8|22|indeed the worst of living creatures in the sight of allah are the deaf and dumb who do not use reason
8|23|had allah known any good in them he would have made them hear and if he had made them hear they would still have turned away while they were refusing
8|24|o you who have believed respond to allah and to the messenger when he calls you to that which gives you life and know that allah intervenes between a man and his heart and that to him you will be gathered
8|25|and fear a trial which will not strike those who have wronged among you exclusively and know that allah is severe in penalty
8|26|and remember when you were few and oppressed in the land fearing that people might abduct you but he sheltered you supported you with his victory and provided you with good things that you might be grateful
8|27|o you who have believed do not betray allah and the messenger or betray your trusts while you know the consequence
8|28|and know that your properties and your children are but a trial and that allah has with him a great reward
8|29|o you who have believed if you fear allah he will grant you a criterion and will remove from you your misdeeds and forgive you and allah is the possessor of great bounty
8|30|and remember o muhammad when those who disbelieved plotted against you to restrain you or kill you or evict you from makkah but they plan and allah plans and allah is the best of planners
8|31|and when our verses are recited to them they say we have heard if we willed we could say something like this this is not but legends of the former peoples
8|32|and remember when they said o allah if this should be the truth from you then rain down upon us stones from the sky or bring us a painful punishment
8|33|but allah would not punish them while you o muhammad are among them and allah would not punish them while they seek forgiveness
8|34|but why should allah not punish them while they obstruct people from al masjid al haram and they were not fit to be its guardians its true guardians are not but the righteous but most of them do not know
8|35|and their prayer at the house was not except whistling and handclapping so taste the punishment for what you disbelieved
8|36|indeed those who disbelieve spend their wealth to avert people from the way of allah so they will spend it then it will be for them a source of regret then they will be overcome and those who have disbelieved unto hell they will be gathered
8|37|this is so that allah may distinguish the wicked from the good and place the wicked some of them upon others and heap them all together and put them into hell it is those who are the losers
8|38|say to those who have disbelieved that if they cease what has previously occurred will be forgiven for them but if they return to hostility then the precedent of the former rebellious peoples has already taken place
8|39|and fight them until there is no fitnah and until the religion all of it is for allah and if they cease then indeed allah is seeing of what they do
8|40|but if they turn away then know that allah is your protector excellent is the protector and excellent is the helper
8|41|and know that anything you obtain of war booty then indeed for allah is one fifth of it and for the messenger and for his near relatives and the orphans the needy and the stranded traveler if you have believed in allah and in that which we sent down to our servant on the day of criterion the day when the two armies met and allah over all things is competent
8|42|remember when you were on the near side of the valley and they were on the farther side and the caravan was lower in position than you if you had made an appointment to meet you would have missed the appointment but it was so that allah might accomplish a matter already destined that those who perished through disbelief would perish upon evidence and those who lived in faith would live upon evidence and indeed allah is hearing and knowing
8|43|remember o muhammad when allah showed them to you in your dream as few and if he had shown them to you as many you believers would have lost courage and would have disputed in the matter of whether to fight but allah saved you from that indeed he is knowing of that within the breasts
8|44|and remember when he showed them to you when you met as few in your eyes and he made you appear as few in their eyes so that allah might accomplish a matter already destined and to allah are all matters returned
8|45|o you who have believed when you encounter a company from the enemy forces stand firm and remember allah much that you may be successful
8|46|and obey allah and his messenger and do not dispute and thus lose courage and then your strength would depart and be patient indeed allah is with the patient
8|47|and do not be like those who came forth from their homes insolently and to be seen by people and avert them from the way of allah and allah is encompassing of what they do
8|48|and remember when satan made their deeds pleasing to them and said no one can overcome you today from among the people and indeed i am your protector but when the two armies sighted each other he turned on his heels and said indeed i am disassociated from you indeed i see what you do not see indeed i fear allah and allah is severe in penalty
8|49|remember when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts was disease said their religion has deluded those muslims but whoever relies upon allah then indeed allah is exalted in might and wise
8|50|and if you could but see when the angels take the souls of those who disbelieved they are striking their faces and their backs and saying taste the punishment of the burning fire
8|51|that is for what your hands have put forth of evil and because allah is not ever unjust to his servants
8|52|theirs is like the custom of the people of pharaoh and of those before them they disbelieved in the signs of allah so allah seized them for their sins indeed allah is powerful and severe in penalty
8|53|that is because allah would not change a favor which he had bestowed upon a people until they change what is within themselves and indeed allah is hearing and knowing
8|54|theirs is like the custom of the people of pharaoh and of those before them they denied the signs of their lord so we destroyed them for their sins and we drowned the people of pharaoh and all of them were wrongdoers
8|55|indeed the worst of living creatures in the sight of allah are those who have disbelieved and they will not ever believe
8|56|the ones with whom you made a treaty but then they break their pledge every time and they do not fear allah
8|57|so if you o muhammad gain dominance over them in war disperse by means of them those behind them that perhaps they will be reminded
8|58|if you have reason to fear from a people betrayal throw their treaty back to them putting you on equal terms indeed allah does not like traitors
8|59|and let not those who disbelieve think they will escape indeed they will not cause failure to allah
8|60|and prepare against them whatever you are able of power and of steeds of war by which you may terrify the enemy of allah and your enemy and others besides them whom you do not know but whom allah knows and whatever you spend in the cause of allah will be fully repaid to you and you will not be wronged
8|61|and if they incline to peace then incline to it also and rely upon allah indeed it is he who is the hearing the knowing
8|62|but if they intend to deceive you then sufficient for you is allah it is he who supported you with his help and with the believers
8|63|and brought together their hearts if you had spent all that is in the earth you could not have brought their hearts together but allah brought them together indeed he is exalted in might and wise
8|64|o prophet sufficient for you is allah and for whoever follows you of the believers
8|65|o prophet urge the believers to battle if there are among you twenty who are steadfast they will overcome two hundred and if there are among you one hundred who are steadfast they will overcome a thousand of those who have disbelieved because they are a people who do not understand
8|66|now allah has lightened the hardship for you and he knows that among you is weakness so if there are from you one hundred who are steadfast they will overcome two hundred and if there are among you a thousand they will overcome two thousand by permission of allah and allah is with the steadfast
8|67|it is not for a prophet to have captives of war until he inflicts a massacre upon allah s enemies in the land some muslims desire the commodities of this world but allah desires for you the hereafter and allah is exalted in might and wise
8|68|if not for a decree from allah that preceded you would have been touched for what you took by a great punishment
8|69|so consume what you have taken of war booty as being lawful and good and fear allah indeed allah is forgiving and merciful
8|70|o prophet say to whoever is in your hands of the captives if allah knows any good in your hearts he will give you something better than what was taken from you and he will forgive you and allah is forgiving and merciful
8|71|but if they intend to betray you then they have already betrayed allah before and he empowered you over them and allah is knowing and wise
8|72|indeed those who have believed and emigrated and fought with their wealth and lives in the cause of allah and those who gave shelter and aided they are allies of one another but those who believed and did not emigrate for you there is no guardianship of them until they emigrate and if they seek help of you for the religion then you must help except against a people between yourselves and whom is a treaty and allah is seeing of what you do
8|73|and those who disbelieved are allies of one another if you do not do so there will be fitnah on earth and great corruption
8|74|but those who have believed and emigrated and fought in the cause of allah and those who gave shelter and aided it is they who are the believers truly for them is forgiveness and noble provision
8|75|and those who believed after the initial emigration and emigrated and fought with you they are of you but those of blood relationship are more entitled to inheritance in the decree of allah indeed allah is knowing of all things
9|1|this is a declaration of disassociation from allah and his messenger to those with whom you had made a treaty among the polytheists
9|2|so travel freely o disbelievers throughout the land during four months but know that you cannot cause failure to allah and that allah will disgrace the disbelievers
9|3|and it is an announcement from allah and his messenger to the people on the day of the greater pilgrimage that allah is disassociated from the disbelievers and so is his messenger so if you repent that is best for you but if you turn away then know that you will not cause failure to allah and give tidings to those who disbelieve of a painful punishment
9|4|excepted are those with whom you made a treaty among the polytheists and then they have not been deficient toward you in anything or supported anyone against you so complete for them their treaty until their term has ended indeed allah loves the righteous who fear him
9|5|and when the sacred months have passed then kill the polytheists wherever you find them and capture them and besiege them and sit in wait for them at every place of ambush but if they should repent establish prayer and give zakah let them go on their way indeed allah is forgiving and merciful
9|6|and if any one of the polytheists seeks your protection then grant him protection so that he may hear the words of allah then deliver him to his place of safety that is because they are a people who do not know
9|7|how can there be for the polytheists a treaty in the sight of allah and with his messenger except for those with whom you made a treaty at al masjid al haram so as long as they are upright toward you be upright toward them indeed allah loves the righteous who fear him
9|8|how can there be a treaty while if they gain dominance over you they do not observe concerning you any pact of kinship or covenant of protection they satisfy you with their mouths but their hearts refuse compliance and most of them are defiantly disobedient
9|9|they have exchanged the signs of allah for a small price and averted people from his way indeed it was evil that they were doing
9|10|they do not observe toward a believer any pact of kinship or covenant of protection and it is they who are the transgressors
9|11|but if they repent establish prayer and give zakah then they are your brothers in religion and we detail the verses for a people who know
9|12|and if they break their oaths after their treaty and defame your religion then fight the leaders of disbelief for indeed there are no oaths sacred to them fight them that they might cease
9|13|would you not fight a people who broke their oaths and determined to expel the messenger and they had begun the attack upon you the first time do you fear them but allah has more right that you should fear him if you are truly believers
9|14|fight them allah will punish them by your hands and will disgrace them and give you victory over them and satisfy the breasts of a believing people
9|15|and remove the fury in the believers hearts and allah turns in forgiveness to whom he wills and allah is knowing and wise
9|16|do you think that you will be left as you are while allah has not yet made evident those among you who strive for his cause and do not take other than allah his messenger and the believers as intimates and allah is acquainted with what you do
9|17|it is not for the polytheists to maintain the mosques of allah while witnessing against themselves with disbelief for those their deeds have become worthless and in the fire they will abide eternally
9|18|the mosques of allah are only to be maintained by those who believe in allah and the last day and establish prayer and give zakah and do not fear except allah for it is expected that those will be of the rightly guided
9|19|have you made the providing of water for the pilgrim and the maintenance of al masjid al haram equal to the deeds of one who believes in allah and the last day and strives in the cause of allah they are not equal in the sight of allah and allah does not guide the wrongdoing people
9|20|the ones who have believed emigrated and striven in the cause of allah with their wealth and their lives are greater in rank in the sight of allah and it is those who are the attainers of success
9|21|their lord gives them good tidings of mercy from him and approval and of gardens for them wherein is enduring pleasure
9|22|they will be abiding therein forever indeed allah has with him a great reward
9|23|o you who have believed do not take your fathers or your brothers as allies if they have preferred disbelief over belief and whoever does so among you then it is those who are the wrongdoers
9|24|say o muhammad if your fathers your sons your brothers your wives your relatives wealth which you have obtained commerce wherein you fear decline and dwellings with which you are pleased are more beloved to you than allah and his messenger and jihad in his cause then wait until allah executes his command and allah does not guide the defiantly disobedient people
9|25|allah has already given you victory in many regions and even on the day of hunayn when your great number pleased you but it did not avail you at all and the earth was confining for you with its vastness then you turned back fleeing
9|26|then allah sent down his tranquillity upon his messenger and upon the believers and sent down soldiers angels whom you did not see and punished those who disbelieved and that is the recompense of the disbelievers
9|27|then allah will accept repentance after that for whom he wills and allah is forgiving and merciful
9|28|o you who have believed indeed the polytheists are unclean so let them not approach al masjid al haram after this their final year and if you fear privation allah will enrich you from his bounty if he wills indeed allah is knowing and wise
9|29|fight those who do not believe in allah or in the last day and who do not consider unlawful what allah and his messenger have made unlawful and who do not adopt the religion of truth from those who were given the scripture fight until they give the jizyah willingly while they are humbled
9|30|the jews say ezra is the son of allah and the christians say the messiah is the son of allah that is their statement from their mouths they imitate the saying of those who disbelieved before them may allah destroy them how are they deluded
9|31|they have taken their scholars and monks as lords besides allah and also the messiah the son of mary and they were not commanded except to worship one god there is no deity except him exalted is he above whatever they associate with him
9|32|they want to extinguish the light of allah with their mouths but allah refuses except to perfect his light although the disbelievers dislike it
9|33|it is he who has sent his messenger with guidance and the religion of truth to manifest it over all religion although they who associate others with allah dislike it
9|34|o you who have believed indeed many of the scholars and the monks devour the wealth of people unjustly and avert them from the way of allah and those who hoard gold and silver and spend it not in the way of allah give them tidings of a painful punishment
9|35|the day when it will be heated in the fire of hell and seared therewith will be their foreheads their flanks and their backs it will be said this is what you hoarded for yourselves so taste what you used to hoard
9|36|indeed the number of months with allah is twelve lunar months in the register of allah from the day he created the heavens and the earth of these four are sacred that is the correct religion so do not wrong yourselves during them and fight against the disbelievers collectively as they fight against you collectively and know that allah is with the righteous who fear him
9|37|indeed the postponing of restriction within sacred months is an increase in disbelief by which those who have disbelieved are led further astray they make it lawful one year and unlawful another year to correspond to the number made unlawful by allah and thus make lawful what allah has made unlawful made pleasing to them is the evil of their deeds and allah does not guide the disbelieving people
9|38|o you who have believed what is the matter with you that when you are told to go forth in the cause of allah you adhere heavily to the earth are you satisfied with the life of this world rather than the hereafter but what is the enjoyment of worldly life compared to the hereafter except a very little
9|39|if you do not go forth he will punish you with a painful punishment and will replace you with another people and you will not harm him at all and allah is over all things competent
9|40|if you do not aid the prophet allah has already aided him when those who disbelieved had driven him out of makkah as one of two when they were in the cave and he said to his companion do not grieve indeed allah is with us and allah sent down his tranquillity upon him and supported him with angels you did not see and made the word of those who disbelieved the lowest while the word of allah that is the highest and allah is exalted in might and wise
9|41|go forth whether light or heavy and strive with your wealth and your lives in the cause of allah that is better for you if you only knew
9|42|had it been an easy gain and a moderate trip the hypocrites would have followed you but distant to them was the journey and they will swear by allah if we were able we would have gone forth with you destroying themselves through false oaths and allah knows that indeed they are liars
9|43|may allah pardon you o muhammad why did you give them permission to remain behind you should not have until it was evident to you who were truthful and you knew who were the liars
9|44|those who believe in allah and the last day would not ask permission of you to be excused from striving with their wealth and their lives and allah is knowing of those who fear him
9|45|only those would ask permission of you who do not believe in allah and the last day and whose hearts have doubted and they in their doubt are hesitating
9|46|and if they had intended to go forth they would have prepared for it some preparation but allah disliked their being sent so he kept them back and they were told remain behind with those who remain
9|47|had they gone forth with you they would not have increased you except in confusion and they would have been active among you seeking to cause you fitnah and among you are avid listeners to them and allah is knowing of the wrongdoers
9|48|they had already desired dissension before and had upset matters for you until the truth came and the ordinance of allah appeared while they were averse
9|49|and among them is he who says permit me to remain at home and do not put me to trial unquestionably into trial they have fallen and indeed hell will encompass the disbelievers
9|50|if good befalls you it distresses them but if disaster strikes you they say we took our matter in hand before and turn away while they are rejoicing
9|51|say never will we be struck except by what allah has decreed for us he is our protector and upon allah let the believers rely
9|52|say do you await for us except one of the two best things while we await for you that allah will afflict you with punishment from himself or at our hands so wait indeed we along with you are waiting
9|53|say spend willingly or unwillingly never will it be accepted from you indeed you have been a defiantly disobedient people
9|54|and what prevents their expenditures from being accepted from them but that they have disbelieved in allah and in his messenger and that they come not to prayer except while they are lazy and that they do not spend except while they are unwilling
9|55|so let not their wealth or their children impress you allah only intends to punish them through them in worldly life and that their souls should depart at death while they are disbelievers
9|56|and they swear by allah that they are from among you while they are not from among you but they are a people who are afraid
9|57|if they could find a refuge or some caves or any place to enter and hide they would turn to it while they run heedlessly
9|58|and among them are some who criticize you concerning the distribution of charities if they are given from them they approve but if they are not given from them at once they become angry
9|59|if only they had been satisfied with what allah and his messenger gave them and said sufficient for us is allah allah will give us of his bounty and so will his messenger indeed we are desirous toward allah it would have been better for them
9|60|zakah expenditures are only for the poor and for the needy and for those employed to collect zakah and for bringing hearts together for islam and for freeing captives or slaves and for those in debt and for the cause of allah and for the stranded traveler an obligation imposed by allah and allah is knowing and wise
9|61|and among them are those who abuse the prophet and say he is an ear say it is an ear of goodness for you that believes in allah and believes the believers and is a mercy to those who believe among you and those who abuse the messenger of allah for them is a painful punishment
9|62|they swear by allah to you muslims to satisfy you but allah and his messenger are more worthy for them to satisfy if they should be believers
9|63|do they not know that whoever opposes allah and his messenger that for him is the fire of hell wherein he will abide eternally that is the great disgrace
9|64|they hypocrites are apprehensive lest a surah be revealed about them informing them of what is in their hearts say mock as you wish indeed allah will expose that which you fear
9|65|and if you ask them they will surely say we were only conversing and playing say is it allah and his verses and his messenger that you were mocking
9|66|make no excuse you have disbelieved after your belief if we pardon one faction of you we will punish another faction because they were criminals
9|67|the hypocrite men and hypocrite women are of one another they enjoin what is wrong and forbid what is right and close their hands they have forgotten allah so he has forgotten them accordingly indeed the hypocrites it is they who are the defiantly disobedient
9|68|allah has promised the hypocrite men and hypocrite women and the disbelievers the fire of hell wherein they will abide eternally it is sufficient for them and allah has cursed them and for them is an enduring punishment
9|69|you disbelievers are like those before you they were stronger than you in power and more abundant in wealth and children they enjoyed their portion of worldly enjoyment and you have enjoyed your portion as those before you enjoyed their portion and you have engaged in vanities like that in which they engaged it is those whose deeds have become worthless in this world and in the hereafter and it is they who are the losers
9|70|has there not reached them the news of those before them the people of noah and the tribes of aad and thamud and the people of abraham and the companions of madyan and the towns overturned their messengers came to them with clear proofs and allah would never have wronged them but they were wronging themselves
9|71|the believing men and believing women are allies of one another they enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and establish prayer and give zakah and obey allah and his messenger those allah will have mercy upon them indeed allah is exalted in might and wise
9|72|allah has promised the believing men and believing women gardens beneath which rivers flow wherein they abide eternally and pleasant dwellings in gardens of perpetual residence but approval from allah is greater it is that which is the great attainment
9|73|o prophet fight against the disbelievers and the hypocrites and be harsh upon them and their refuge is hell and wretched is the destination
9|74|they swear by allah that they did not say anything against the prophet while they had said the word of disbelief and disbelieved after their pretense of islam and planned that which they were not to attain and they were not resentful except for the fact that allah and his messenger had enriched them of his bounty so if they repent it is better for them but if they turn away allah will punish them with a painful punishment in this world and the hereafter and there will not be for them on earth any protector or helper
9|75|and among them are those who made a covenant with allah saying if he should give us from his bounty we will surely spend in charity and we will surely be among the righteous
9|76|but when he gave them from his bounty they were stingy with it and turned away while they refused
9|77|so he penalized them with hypocrisy in their hearts until the day they will meet him because they failed allah in what they promised him and because they habitually used to lie
9|78|did they not know that allah knows their secrets and their private conversations and that allah is the knower of the unseen
9|79|those who criticize the contributors among the believers concerning their charities and criticize the ones who find nothing to spend except their effort so they ridicule them allah will ridicule them and they will have a painful punishment
9|80|ask forgiveness for them o muhammad or do not ask forgiveness for them if you should ask forgiveness for them seventy times never will allah forgive them that is because they disbelieved in allah and his messenger and allah does not guide the defiantly disobedient people
9|81|those who remained behind rejoiced in their staying at home after the departure of the messenger of allah and disliked to strive with their wealth and their lives in the cause of allah and said do not go forth in the heat say the fire of hell is more intensive in heat if they would but understand
9|82|so let them laugh a little and then weep much as recompense for what they used to earn
9|83|if allah should return you to a faction of them after the expedition and then they ask your permission to go out to battle say you will not go out with me ever and you will never fight with me an enemy indeed you were satisfied with sitting at home the first time so sit now with those who stay behind
9|84|and do not pray the funeral prayer o muhammad over any of them who has died ever or stand at his grave indeed they disbelieved in allah and his messenger and died while they were defiantly disobedient
9|85|and let not their wealth and their children impress you allah only intends to punish them through them in this world and that their souls should depart at death while they are disbelievers
9|86|and when a surah was revealed enjoining them to believe in allah and to fight with his messenger those of wealth among them asked your permission to stay back and said leave us to be with them who sit at home
9|87|they were satisfied to be with those who stay behind and their hearts were sealed over so they do not understand
9|88|but the messenger and those who believed with him fought with their wealth and their lives those will have all that is good and it is those who are the successful
9|89|allah has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide eternally that is the great attainment
9|90|and those with excuses among the bedouins came to be permitted to remain and they who had lied to allah and his messenger sat at home there will strike those who disbelieved among them a painful punishment
9|91|there is not upon the weak or upon the ill or upon those who do not find anything to spend any discomfort when they are sincere to allah and his messenger there is not upon the doers of good any cause for blame and allah is forgiving and merciful
9|92|nor is there blame upon those who when they came to you that you might give them mounts you said i can find nothing for you to ride upon they turned back while their eyes overflowed with tears out of grief that they could not find something to spend for the cause of allah
9|93|the cause for blame is only upon those who ask permission of you while they are rich they are satisfied to be with those who stay behind and allah has sealed over their hearts so they do not know
9|94|they will make excuses to you when you have returned to them say make no excuse never will we believe you allah has already informed us of your news and allah will observe your deeds and so will his messenger then you will be taken back to the knower of the unseen and the witnessed and he will inform you of what you used to do
9|95|they will swear by allah to you when you return to them that you would leave them alone so leave them alone indeed they are evil and their refuge is hell as recompense for what they had been earning
9|96|they swear to you so that you might be satisfied with them but if you should be satisfied with them indeed allah is not satisfied with a defiantly disobedient people
9|97|the bedouins are stronger in disbelief and hypocrisy and more likely not to know the limits of what laws allah has revealed to his messenger and allah is knowing and wise
9|98|and among the bedouins are some who consider what they spend as a loss and await for you turns of misfortune upon them will be a misfortune of evil and allah is hearing and knowing
9|99|but among the bedouins are some who believe in allah and the last day and consider what they spend as means of nearness to allah and of obtaining invocations of the messenger unquestionably it is a means of nearness for them allah will admit them to his mercy indeed allah is forgiving and merciful
9|100|and the first forerunners in the faith among the muhajireen and the ansar and those who followed them with good conduct allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with him and he has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide forever that is the great attainment
9|101|and among those around you of the bedouins are hypocrites and also from the people of madinah they have become accustomed to hypocrisy you o muhammad do not know them but we know them we will punish them twice in this world then they will be returned to a great punishment
9|102|and there are others who have acknowledged their sins they had mixed a righteous deed with another that was bad perhaps allah will turn to them in forgiveness indeed allah is forgiving and merciful
9|103|take o muhammad from their wealth a charity by which you purify them and cause them increase and invoke allah s blessings upon them indeed your invocations are reassurance for them and allah is hearing and knowing
9|104|do they not know that it is allah who accepts repentance from his servants and receives charities and that it is allah who is the accepting of repentance the merciful
9|105|and say do as you will for allah will see your deeds and so will his messenger and the believers and you will be returned to the knower of the unseen and the witnessed and he will inform you of what you used to do
9|106|and there are others deferred until the command of allah whether he will punish them or whether he will forgive them and allah is knowing and wise
9|107|and there are those hypocrites who took for themselves a mosque for causing harm and disbelief and division among the believers and as a station for whoever had warred against allah and his messenger before and they will surely swear we intended only the best and allah testifies that indeed they are liars
9|108|do not stand for prayer within it ever a mosque founded on righteousness from the first day is more worthy for you to stand in within it are men who love to purify themselves and allah loves those who purify themselves
9|109|then is one who laid the foundation of his building on righteousness with fear from allah and seeking his approval better or one who laid the foundation of his building on the edge of a bank about to collapse so it collapsed with him into the fire of hell and allah does not guide the wrongdoing people
9|110|their building which they built will not cease to be a cause of skepticism in their hearts until their hearts are stopped and allah is knowing and wise
9|111|indeed allah has purchased from the believers their lives and their properties in exchange for that they will have paradise they fight in the cause of allah so they kill and are killed it is a true promise binding upon him in the torah and the gospel and the qur an and who is truer to his covenant than allah so rejoice in your transaction which you have contracted and it is that which is the great attainment
9|112|such believers are the repentant the worshippers the praisers of allah the travelers for his cause those who bow and prostrate in prayer those who enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and those who observe the limits set by allah and give good tidings to the believers
9|113|it is not for the prophet and those who have believed to ask forgiveness for the polytheists even if they were relatives after it has become clear to them that they are companions of hellfire
9|114|and the request of forgiveness of abraham for his father was only because of a promise he had made to him but when it became apparent to abraham that his father was an enemy to allah he disassociated himself from him indeed was abraham compassionate and patient
9|115|and allah would not let a people stray after he has guided them until he makes clear to them what they should avoid indeed allah is knowing of all things
9|116|indeed to allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth he gives life and causes death and you have not besides allah any protector or any helper
9|117|allah has already forgiven the prophet and the muhajireen and the ansar who followed him in the hour of difficulty after the hearts of a party of them had almost inclined to doubt and then he forgave them indeed he was to them kind and merciful
9|118|and he also forgave the three who were left behind and regretted their error to the point that the earth closed in on them in spite of its vastness and their souls confined them and they were certain that there is no refuge from allah except in him then he turned to them so they could repent indeed allah is the accepting of repentance the merciful
9|119|o you who have believed fear allah and be with those who are true
9|120|it was not proper for the people of madinah and those surrounding them of the bedouins that they remain behind after the departure of the messenger of allah or that they prefer themselves over his self that is because they are not afflicted by thirst or fatigue or hunger in the cause of allah nor do they tread on any ground that enrages the disbelievers nor do they inflict upon an enemy any infliction but that is registered for them as a righteous deed indeed allah does not allow to be lost the reward of the doers of good
9|121|nor do they spend an expenditure small or large or cross a valley but that it is registered for them that allah may reward them for the best of what they were doing
9|122|and it is not for the believers to go forth to battle all at once for there should separate from every division of them a group remaining to obtain understanding in the religion and warn their people when they return to them that they might be cautious
9|123|o you who have believed fight those adjacent to you of the disbelievers and let them find in you harshness and know that allah is with the righteous
9|124|and whenever a surah is revealed there are among the hypocrites those who say which of you has this increased faith as for those who believed it has increased them in faith while they are rejoicing
9|125|but as for those in whose hearts is disease it has only increased them in evil in addition to their evil and they will have died while they are disbelievers
9|126|do they not see that they are tried every year once or twice but then they do not repent nor do they remember
9|127|and whenever a surah is revealed they look at each other saying does anyone see you and then they dismiss themselves allah has dismissed their hearts because they are a people who do not understand
9|128|there has certainly come to you a messenger from among yourselves grievous to him is what you suffer he is concerned over you and to the believers is kind and merciful
9|129|but if they turn away o muhammad say sufficient for me is allah there is no deity except him on him i have relied and he is the lord of the great throne
10|1|alif lam ra these are the verses of the wise book
10|2|have the people been amazed that we revealed revelation to a man from among them saying warn mankind and give good tidings to those who believe that they will have a firm precedence of honor with their lord but the disbelievers say indeed this is an obvious magician
10|3|indeed your lord is allah who created the heavens and the earth in six days and then established himself above the throne arranging the matter of his creation there is no intercessor except after his permission that is allah your lord so worship him then will you not remember
10|4|to him is your return all together it is the promise of allah which is truth indeed he begins the process of creation and then repeats it that he may reward those who have believed and done righteous deeds in justice but those who disbelieved will have a drink of scalding water and a painful punishment for what they used to deny
10|5|it is he who made the sun a shining light and the moon a derived light and determined for it phases that you may know the number of years and account of time allah has not created this except in truth he details the signs for a people who know
10|6|indeed in the alternation of the night and the day and in what allah has created in the heavens and the earth are signs for a people who fear allah
10|7|indeed those who do not expect the meeting with us and are satisfied with the life of this world and feel secure therein and those who are heedless of our signs
10|8|for those their refuge will be the fire because of what they used to earn
10|9|indeed those who have believed and done righteous deeds their lord will guide them because of their faith beneath them rivers will flow in the gardens of pleasure
10|10|their call therein will be exalted are you o allah and their greeting therein will be peace and the last of their call will be praise to allah lord of the worlds
10|11|and if allah was to hasten for the people the evil they invoke as he hastens for them the good their term would have been ended for them but we leave the ones who do not expect the meeting with us in their transgression wandering blindly
10|12|and when affliction touches man he calls upon us whether lying on his side or sitting or standing but when we remove from him his affliction he continues in disobedience as if he had never called upon us to remove an affliction that touched him thus is made pleasing to the transgressors that which they have been doing
10|13|and we had already destroyed generations before you when they wronged and their messengers had come to them with clear proofs but they were not to believe thus do we recompense the criminal people
10|14|then we made you successors in the land after them so that we may observe how you will do
10|15|and when our verses are recited to them as clear evidences those who do not expect the meeting with us say bring us a qur an other than this or change it say o muhammad it is not for me to change it on my own accord i only follow what is revealed to me indeed i fear if i should disobey my lord the punishment of a tremendous day
10|16|say if allah had willed i would not have recited it to you nor would he have made it known to you for i had remained among you a lifetime before it then will you not reason
10|17|so who is more unjust than he who invents a lie about allah or denies his signs indeed the criminals will not succeed
10|18|and they worship other than allah that which neither harms them nor benefits them and they say these are our intercessors with allah say do you inform allah of something he does not know in the heavens or on the earth exalted is he and high above what they associate with him
10|19|and mankind was not but one community united in religion but then they differed and if not for a word that preceded from your lord it would have been judged between them immediately concerning that over which they differ
10|20|and they say why is a sign not sent down to him from his lord so say the unseen is only for allah to administer so wait indeed i am with you among those who wait
10|21|and when we give the people a taste of mercy after adversity has touched them at once they conspire against our verses say allah is swifter in strategy indeed our messengers record that which you conspire
10|22|it is he who enables you to travel on land and sea until when you are in ships and they sail with them by a good wind and they rejoice therein there comes a storm wind and the waves come upon them from everywhere and they assume that they are surrounded supplicating allah sincere to him in religion if you should save us from this we will surely be among the thankful
10|23|but when he saves them at once they commit injustice upon the earth without right o mankind your injustice is only against yourselves being merely the enjoyment of worldly life then to us is your return and we will inform you of what you used to do
10|24|the example of this worldly life is but like rain which we have sent down from the sky that the plants of the earth absorb those from which men and livestock eat until when the earth has taken on its adornment and is beautified and its people suppose that they have capability over it there comes to it our command by night or by day and we make it as a harvest as if it had not flourished yesterday thus do we explain in detail the signs for a people who give thought
10|25|and allah invites to the home of peace and guides whom he wills to a straight path
10|26|for them who have done good is the best reward and extra no darkness will cover their faces nor humiliation those are companions of paradise they will abide therein eternally
10|27|but they who have earned blame for evil doings the recompense of an evil deed is its equivalent and humiliation will cover them they will have from allah no protector it will be as if their faces are covered with pieces of the night so dark are they those are the companions of the fire they will abide therein eternally
10|28|and mention o muhammad the day we will gather them all together then we will say to those who associated others with allah remain in your place you and your partners then we will separate them and their partners will say you did not used to worship us
10|29|and sufficient is allah as a witness between us and you that we were of your worship unaware
10|30|there on that day every soul will be put to trial for what it did previously and they will be returned to allah their master the truth and lost from them is whatever they used to invent
10|31|say who provides for you from the heaven and the earth or who controls hearing and sight and who brings the living out of the dead and brings the dead out of the living and who arranges every matter they will say allah so say then will you not fear him
10|32|for that is allah your lord the truth and what can be beyond truth except error so how are you averted
10|33|thus the word of your lord has come into effect upon those who defiantly disobeyed that they will not believe
10|34|say are there of your partners any who begins creation and then repeats it say allah begins creation and then repeats it so how are you deluded
10|35|say are there of your partners any who guides to the truth say allah guides to the truth so is he who guides to the truth more worthy to be followed or he who guides not unless he is guided then what is wrong with you how do you judge
10|36|and most of them follow not except assumption indeed assumption avails not against the truth at all indeed allah is knowing of what they do
10|37|and it was not possible for this qur an to be produced by other than allah but it is a confirmation of what was before it and a detailed explanation of the former scripture about which there is no doubt from the lord of the worlds
10|38|or do they say about the prophet he invented it say then bring forth a surah like it and call upon for assistance whomever you can besides allah if you should be truthful
10|39|rather they have denied that which they encompass not in knowledge and whose interpretation has not yet come to them thus did those before them deny then observe how was the end of the wrongdoers
10|40|and of them are those who believe in it and of them are those who do not believe in it and your lord is most knowing of the corrupters
10|41|and if they deny you o muhammad then say for me are my deeds and for you are your deeds you are disassociated from what i do and i am disassociated from what you do
10|42|and among them are those who listen to you but can you cause the deaf to hear although they will not use reason
10|43|and among them are those who look at you but can you guide the blind although they will not attempt to see
10|44|indeed allah does not wrong the people at all but it is the people who are wronging themselves
10|45|and on the day when he will gather them it will be as if they had not remained in the world but an hour of the day and they will know each other those will have lost who denied the meeting with allah and were not guided
10|46|and whether we show you some of what we promise them o muhammad or we take you in death to us is their return then either way allah is a witness concerning what they are doing
10|47|and for every nation is a messenger so when their messenger comes it will be judged between them in justice and they will not be wronged
10|48|and they say when is the fulfillment of this promise if you should be truthful
10|49|say i possess not for myself any harm or benefit except what allah should will for every nation is a specified term when their time has come then they will not remain behind an hour nor will they precede it
10|50|say have you considered if his punishment should come to you by night or by day for which aspect of it would the criminals be impatient
10|51|then is it that when it has actually occurred you will believe in it now and you were once for it impatient
10|52|then it will be said to those who had wronged taste the punishment of eternity are you being recompensed except for what you used to earn
10|53|and they ask information of you o muhammad is it true say yes by my lord indeed it is truth and you will not cause failure to allah
10|54|and if each soul that wronged had everything on earth it would offer it in ransom and they will confide regret when they see the punishment and they will be judged in justice and they will not be wronged
10|55|unquestionably to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth unquestionably the promise of allah is truth but most of them do not know
10|56|he gives life and causes death and to him you will be returned
10|57|o mankind there has to come to you instruction from your lord and healing for what is in the breasts and guidance and mercy for the believers
10|58|say in the bounty of allah and in his mercy in that let them rejoice it is better than what they accumulate
10|59|say have you seen what allah has sent down to you of provision of which you have made some lawful and some unlawful say has allah permitted you to do so or do you invent something about allah
10|60|and what will be the supposition of those who invent falsehood about allah on the day of resurrection indeed allah is full of bounty to the people but most of them are not grateful
10|61|and o muhammad you are not engaged in any matter or recite any of the qur an and you people do not do any deed except that we are witness over you when you are involved in it and not absent from your lord is any part of an atom s weight within the earth or within the heaven or anything smaller than that or greater but that it is in a clear register
10|62|unquestionably for the allies of allah there will be no fear concerning them nor will they grieve
10|63|those who believed and were fearing allah
10|64|for them are good tidings in the worldly life and in the hereafter no change is there in the words of allah that is what is the great attainment
10|65|and let not their speech grieve you indeed honor due to power belongs to allah entirely he is the hearing the knowing
10|66|unquestionably to allah belongs whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth and those who invoke other than allah do not actually follow his partners they follow not except assumption and they are not but falsifying
10|67|it is he who made for you the night to rest therein and the day giving sight indeed in that are signs for a people who listen
10|68|they have said allah has taken a son exalted is he he is the one free of need to him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth you have no authority for this claim do you say about allah that which you do not know
10|69|say indeed those who invent falsehood about allah will not succeed
10|70|for them is brief enjoyment in this world then to us is their return then we will make them taste the severe punishment because they used to disbelieve
10|71|and recite to them the news of noah when he said to his people o my people if my residence and my reminding of the signs of allah has become burdensome upon you then i have relied upon allah so resolve upon your plan and call upon your associates then let not your plan be obscure to you then carry it out upon me and do not give me respite
10|72|and if you turn away from my advice then no payment have i asked of you my reward is only from allah and i have been commanded to be of the muslims
10|73|and they denied him so we saved him and those with him in the ship and made them successors and we drowned those who denied our signs then see how was the end of those who were warned
10|74|then we sent after him messengers to their peoples and they came to them with clear proofs but they were not to believe in that which they had denied before thus we seal over the hearts of the transgressors
10|75|then we sent after them moses and aaron to pharaoh and his establishment with our signs but they behaved arrogantly and were a criminal people
10|76|so when there came to them the truth from us they said indeed this is obvious magic
10|77|moses said do you say thus about the truth when it has come to you is this magic but magicians will not succeed
10|78|they said have you come to us to turn us away from that upon which we found our fathers and so that you two may have grandeur in the land and we are not believers in you
10|79|and pharaoh said bring to me every learned magician
10|80|so when the magicians came moses said to them throw down whatever you will throw
10|81|and when they had thrown moses said what you have brought is only magic indeed allah will expose its worthlessness indeed allah does not amend the work of corrupters
10|82|and allah will establish the truth by his words even if the criminals dislike it
10|83|but no one believed moses except some youths among his people for fear of pharaoh and his establishment that they would persecute them and indeed pharaoh was haughty within the land and indeed he was of the transgressors
10|84|and moses said o my people if you have believed in allah then rely upon him if you should be muslims
10|85|so they said upon allah do we rely our lord make us not objects of trial for the wrongdoing people
10|86|and save us by your mercy from the disbelieving people
10|87|and we inspired to moses and his brother settle your people in egypt in houses and make your houses facing the qiblah and establish prayer and give good tidings to the believers
10|88|and moses said our lord indeed you have given pharaoh and his establishment splendor and wealth in the worldly life our lord that they may lead men astray from your way our lord obliterate their wealth and harden their hearts so that they will not believe until they see the painful punishment
10|89|allah said your supplication has been answered so remain on a right course and follow not the way of those who do not know
10|90|and we took the children of israel across the sea and pharaoh and his soldiers pursued them in tyranny and enmity until when drowning overtook him he said i believe that there is no deity except that in whom the children of israel believe and i am of the muslims
10|91|now and you had disobeyed him before and were of the corrupters
10|92|so today we will save you in body that you may be to those who succeed you a sign and indeed many among the people of our signs are heedless
10|93|and we had certainty settled the children of israel in an agreeable settlement and provided them with good things and they did not differ until after knowledge had come to them indeed your lord will judge between them on the day of resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ
10|94|so if you are in doubt o muhammad about that which we have revealed to you then ask those who have been reading the scripture before you the truth has certainly come to you from your lord so never be among the doubters
10|95|and never be of those who deny the signs of allah and thus be among the losers
10|96|indeed those upon whom the word of your lord has come into effect will not believe
10|97|even if every sign should come to them until they see the painful punishment
10|98|then has there not been a single city that believed so its faith benefited it except the people of jonah when they believed we removed from them the punishment of disgrace in worldly life and gave them enjoyment for a time
10|99|and had your lord willed those on earth would have believed all of them entirely then o muhammad would you compel the people in order that they become believers
10|100|and it is not for a soul to believe except by permission of allah and he will place defilement upon those who will not use reason
10|101|say observe what is in the heavens and earth but of no avail will be signs or warners to a people who do not believe
10|102|so do they wait except for like what occurred in the days of those who passed on before them say then wait indeed i am with you among those who wait
10|103|then we will save our messengers and those who have believed thus it is an obligation upon us that we save the believers
10|104|say o muhammad o people if you are in doubt as to my religion then i do not worship those which you worship besides allah but i worship allah who causes your death and i have been commanded to be of the believers
10|105|and commanded direct your face toward the religion inclining to truth and never be of those who associate others with allah
10|106|and do not invoke besides allah that which neither benefits you nor harms you for if you did then indeed you would be of the wrongdoers
10|107|and if allah should touch you with adversity there is no remover of it except him and if he intends for you good then there is no repeller of his bounty he causes it to reach whom he wills of his servants and he is the forgiving the merciful
10|108|say o mankind the truth has come to you from your lord so whoever is guided is only guided for the benefit of his soul and whoever goes astray only goes astray in violation against it and i am not over you a manager
10|109|and follow what is revealed to you o muhammad and be patient until allah will judge and he is the best of judges
11|1|alif lam ra this is a book whose verses are perfected and then presented in detail from one who is wise and acquainted
11|2|through a messenger saying do not worship except allah indeed i am to you from him a warner and a bringer of good tidings
11|3|and saying seek forgiveness of your lord and repent to him and he will let you enjoy a good provision for a specified term and give every doer of favor his favor but if you turn away then indeed i fear for you the punishment of a great day
11|4|to allah is your return and he is over all things competent
11|5|unquestionably they the disbelievers turn away their breasts to hide themselves from him unquestionably even when they cover themselves in their clothing allah knows what they conceal and what they declare indeed he is knowing of that within the breasts
11|6|and there is no creature on earth but that upon allah is its provision and he knows its place of dwelling and place of storage all is in a clear register
11|7|and it is he who created the heavens and the earth in six days and his throne had been upon water that he might test you as to which of you is best in deed but if you say indeed you are resurrected after death those who disbelieve will surely say this is not but obvious magic
11|8|and if we hold back from them the punishment for a limited time they will surely say what detains it unquestionably on the day it comes to them it will not be averted from them and they will be enveloped by what they used to ridicule
11|9|and if we give man a taste of mercy from us and then we withdraw it from him indeed he is despairing and ungrateful
11|10|but if we give him a taste of favor after hardship has touched him he will surely say bad times have left me indeed he is exultant and boastful
11|11|except for those who are patient and do righteous deeds those will have forgiveness and great reward
11|12|then would you possibly leave out some of what is revealed to you or is your breast constrained by it because they say why has there not been sent down to him a treasure or come with him an angel but you are only a warner and allah is disposer of all things
11|13|or do they say he invented it say then bring ten surahs like it that have been invented and call upon for assistance whomever you can besides allah if you should be truthful
11|14|and if they do not respond to you then know that the qur an was revealed with the knowledge of allah and that there is no deity except him then would you not be muslims
11|15|whoever desires the life of this world and its adornments we fully repay them for their deeds therein and they therein will not be deprived
11|16|those are the ones for whom there is not in the hereafter but the fire and lost is what they did therein and worthless is what they used to do
11|17|so is one who stands upon a clear evidence from his lord like the aforementioned and a witness from him follows it and before it was the scripture of moses to lead and as mercy those believers in the former revelations believe in the qur an but whoever disbelieves in it from the various factions the fire is his promised destination so be not in doubt about it indeed it is the truth from your lord but most of the people do not believe
11|18|and who is more unjust than he who invents a lie about allah those will be presented before their lord and the witnesses will say these are the ones who lied against their lord unquestionably the curse of allah is upon the wrongdoers
11|19|who averted people from the way of allah and sought to make it seem deviant while they concerning the hereafter were disbelievers
11|20|those were not causing failure to allah on earth nor did they have besides allah any protectors for them the punishment will be multiplied they were not able to hear nor did they see
11|21|those are the ones who will have lost themselves and lost from them is what they used to invent
11|22|assuredly it is they in the hereafter who will be the greatest losers
11|23|indeed they who have believed and done righteous deeds and humbled themselves to their lord those are the companions of paradise they will abide eternally therein
11|24|the example of the two parties is like the blind and deaf and the seeing and hearing are they equal in comparison then will you not remember
11|25|and we had certainly sent noah to his people saying indeed i am to you a clear warner
11|26|that you not worship except allah indeed i fear for you the punishment of a painful day
11|27|so the eminent among those who disbelieved from his people said we do not see you but as a man like ourselves and we do not see you followed except by those who are the lowest of us and at first suggestion and we do not see in you over us any merit rather we think you are liars
11|28|he said o my people have you considered if i should be upon clear evidence from my lord while he has given me mercy from himself but it has been made unapparent to you should we force it upon you while you are averse to it
11|29|and o my people i ask not of you for it any wealth my reward is not but from allah and i am not one to drive away those who have believed indeed they will meet their lord but i see that you are a people behaving ignorantly
11|30|and o my people who would protect me from allah if i drove them away then will you not be reminded
11|31|and i do not tell you that i have the depositories containing the provision of allah or that i know the unseen nor do i tell you that i am an angel nor do i say of those upon whom your eyes look down that allah will never grant them any good allah is most knowing of what is within their souls indeed i would then be among the wrongdoers
11|32|they said o noah you have disputed us and been frequent in dispute of us so bring us what you threaten us if you should be of the truthful
11|33|he said allah will only bring it to you if he wills and you will not cause him failure
11|34|and my advice will not benefit you although i wished to advise you if allah should intend to put you in error he is your lord and to him you will be returned
11|35|or do they say about prophet muhammad he invented it say if i have invented it then upon me is the consequence of my crime but i am innocent of what crimes you commit
11|36|and it was revealed to noah that no one will believe from your people except those who have already believed so do not be distressed by what they have been doing
11|37|and construct the ship under our observation and our inspiration and do not address me concerning those who have wronged indeed they are to be drowned
11|38|and he constructed the ship and whenever an assembly of the eminent of his people passed by him they ridiculed him he said if you ridicule us then we will ridicule you just as you ridicule
11|39|and you are going to know who will get a punishment that will disgrace him on earth and upon whom will descend an enduring punishment in the hereafter
11|40|so it was until when our command came and the oven overflowed we said load upon the ship of each creature two mates and your family except those about whom the word has preceded and include whoever has believed but none had believed with him except a few
11|41|and noah said embark therein in the name of allah is its course and its anchorage indeed my lord is forgiving and merciful
11|42|and it sailed with them through waves like mountains and noah called to his son who was apart from them o my son come aboard with us and be not with the disbelievers
11|43|but he said i will take refuge on a mountain to protect me from the water noah said there is no protector today from the decree of allah except for whom he gives mercy and the waves came between them and he was among the drowned
11|44|and it was said o earth swallow your water and o sky withhold your rain and the water subsided and the matter was accomplished and the ship came to rest on the mountain of judiyy and it was said away with the wrongdoing people
11|45|and noah called to his lord and said my lord indeed my son is of my family and indeed your promise is true and you are the most just of judges
11|46|he said o noah indeed he is not of your family indeed he is one whose work was other than righteous so ask me not for that about which you have no knowledge indeed i advise you lest you be among the ignorant
11|47|noah said my lord i seek refuge in you from asking that of which i have no knowledge and unless you forgive me and have mercy upon me i will be among the losers
11|48|it was said o noah disembark in security from us and blessings upon you and upon nations descending from those with you but other nations of them we will grant enjoyment then there will touch them from us a painful punishment
11|49|that is from the news of the unseen which we reveal to you o muhammad you knew it not neither you nor your people before this so be patient indeed the best outcome is for the righteous
11|50|and to aad we sent their brother hud he said o my people worship allah you have no deity other than him you are not but inventors of falsehood
11|51|o my people i do not ask you for it any reward my reward is only from the one who created me then will you not reason
11|52|and o my people ask forgiveness of your lord and then repent to him he will send rain from the sky upon you in showers and increase you in strength added to your strength and do not turn away being criminals
11|53|they said o hud you have not brought us clear evidence and we are not ones to leave our gods on your say so nor are we believers in you
11|54|we only say that some of our gods have possessed you with evil he said indeed i call allah to witness and witness yourselves that i am free from whatever you associate with allah
11|55|other than him so plot against me all together then do not give me respite
11|56|indeed i have relied upon allah my lord and your lord there is no creature but that he holds its forelock indeed my lord is on a path that is straight
11|57|but if they turn away say i have already conveyed that with which i was sent to you my lord will give succession to a people other than you and you will not harm him at all indeed my lord is over all things guardian
11|58|and when our command came we saved hud and those who believed with him by mercy from us and we saved them from a harsh punishment
11|59|and that was aad who rejected the signs of their lord and disobeyed his messengers and followed the order of every obstinate tyrant
11|60|and they were therefore followed in this world with a curse and as well on the day of resurrection unquestionably aad denied their lord then away with aad the people of hud
11|61|and to thamud we sent their brother salih he said o my people worship allah you have no deity other than him he has produced you from the earth and settled you in it so ask forgiveness of him and then repent to him indeed my lord is near and responsive
11|62|they said o salih you were among us a man of promise before this do you forbid us to worship what our fathers worshipped and indeed we are about that to which you invite us in disquieting doubt
11|63|he said o my people have you considered if i should be upon clear evidence from my lord and he has given me mercy from himself who would protect me from allah if i disobeyed him so you would not increase me except in loss
11|64|and o my people this is the she camel of allah she is to you a sign so let her feed upon allah s earth and do not touch her with harm or you will be taken by an impending punishment
11|65|but they hamstrung her so he said enjoy yourselves in your homes for three days that is a promise not to be denied
11|66|so when our command came we saved salih and those who believed with him by mercy from us and saved them from the disgrace of that day indeed it is your lord who is the powerful the exalted in might
11|67|and the shriek seized those who had wronged and they became within their homes corpses fallen prone
11|68|as if they had never prospered therein unquestionably thamud denied their lord then away with thamud
11|69|and certainly did our messengers come to abraham with good tidings they said peace he said peace and did not delay in bringing them a roasted calf
11|70|but when he saw their hands not reaching for it he distrusted them and felt from them apprehension they said fear not we have been sent to the people of lot
11|71|and his wife was standing and she smiled then we gave her good tidings of isaac and after isaac jacob
11|72|she said woe to me shall i give birth while i am an old woman and this my husband is an old man indeed this is an amazing thing
11|73|they said are you amazed at the decree of allah may the mercy of allah and his blessings be upon you people of the house indeed he is praiseworthy and honorable
11|74|and when the fright had left abraham and the good tidings had reached him he began to argue with us concerning the people of lot
11|75|indeed abraham was forbearing grieving and frequently returning to allah
11|76|the angels said o abraham give up this plea indeed the command of your lord has come and indeed there will reach them a punishment that cannot be repelled
11|77|and when our messengers the angels came to lot he was anguished for them and felt for them great discomfort and said this is a trying day
11|78|and his people came hastening to him and before this they had been doing evil deeds he said o my people these are my daughters they are purer for you so fear allah and do not disgrace me concerning my guests is there not among you a man of reason
11|79|they said you have already known that we have not concerning your daughters any claim and indeed you know what we want
11|80|he said if only i had against you some power or could take refuge in a strong support
11|81|the angels said o lot indeed we are messengers of your lord therefore they will never reach you so set out with your family during a portion of the night and let not any among you look back except your wife indeed she will be struck by that which strikes them indeed their appointment is for the morning is not the morning near
11|82|so when our command came we made the highest part of the city its lowest and rained upon them stones of layered hard clay which were
11|83|marked from your lord and allah s punishment is not from the wrongdoers very far
11|84|and to madyan we sent their brother shu ayb he said o my people worship allah you have no deity other than him and do not decrease from the measure and the scale indeed i see you in prosperity but indeed i fear for you the punishment of an all encompassing day
11|85|and o my people give full measure and weight in justice and do not deprive the people of their due and do not commit abuse on the earth spreading corruption
11|86|what remains lawful from allah is best for you if you would be believers but i am not a guardian over you
11|87|they said o shu ayb does your prayer command you that we should leave what our fathers worship or not do with our wealth what we please indeed you are the forbearing the discerning
11|88|he said o my people have you considered if i am upon clear evidence from my lord and he has provided me with a good provision from him and i do not intend to differ from you in that which i have forbidden you i only intend reform as much as i am able and my success is not but through allah upon him i have relied and to him i return
11|89|and o my people let not your dissension from me cause you to be struck by that similar to what struck the people of noah or the people of hud or the people of salih and the people of lot are not from you far away
11|90|and ask forgiveness of your lord and then repent to him indeed my lord is merciful and affectionate
11|91|they said o shu ayb we do not understand much of what you say and indeed we consider you among us as weak and if not for your family we would have stoned you to death and you are not to us one respected
11|92|he said o my people is my family more respected for power by you than allah but you put him behind your backs in neglect indeed my lord is encompassing of what you do
11|93|and o my people work according to your position indeed i am working you are going to know to whom will come a punishment that will disgrace him and who is a liar so watch indeed i am with you a watcher awaiting the outcome
11|94|and when our command came we saved shu ayb and those who believed with him by mercy from us and the shriek seized those who had wronged and they became within their homes corpses fallen prone
11|95|as if they had never prospered therein then away with madyan as thamud was taken away
11|96|and we did certainly send moses with our signs and a clear authority
11|97|to pharaoh and his establishment but they followed the command of pharaoh and the command of pharaoh was not at all discerning
11|98|he will precede his people on the day of resurrection and lead them into the fire and wretched is the place to which they are led
11|99|and they were followed in this world with a curse and on the day of resurrection and wretched is the gift which is given
11|100|that is from the news of the cities which we relate to you of them some are still standing and some are as a harvest mowed down
11|101|and we did not wrong them but they wronged themselves and they were not availed at all by their gods which they invoked other than allah when there came the command of your lord and they did not increase them in other than ruin
11|102|and thus is the seizure of your lord when he seizes the cities while they are committing wrong indeed his seizure is painful and severe
11|103|indeed in that is a sign for those who fear the punishment of the hereafter that is a day for which the people will be collected and that is a day which will be witnessed
11|104|and we do not delay it except for a limited term
11|105|the day it comes no soul will speak except by his permission and among them will be the wretched and the prosperous
11|106|as for those who were destined to be wretched they will be in the fire for them therein is violent exhaling and inhaling
11|107|they will be abiding therein as long as the heavens and the earth endure except what your lord should will indeed your lord is an effecter of what he intends
11|108|and as for those who were destined to be prosperous they will be in paradise abiding therein as long as the heavens and the earth endure except what your lord should will a bestowal uninterrupted
11|109|so do not be in doubt o muhammad as to what these polytheists are worshipping they worship not except as their fathers worshipped before and indeed we will give them their share undiminished
11|110|and we had certainly given moses the scripture but it came under disagreement and if not for a word that preceded from your lord it would have been judged between them and indeed they are concerning the qur an in disquieting doubt
11|111|and indeed each of the believers and disbelievers your lord will fully compensate them for their deeds indeed he is acquainted with what they do
11|112|so remain on a right course as you have been commanded you and those who have turned back with you to allah and do not transgress indeed he is seeing of what you do
11|113|and do not incline toward those who do wrong lest you be touched by the fire and you would not have other than allah any protectors then you would not be helped
11|114|and establish prayer at the two ends of the day and at the approach of the night indeed good deeds do away with misdeeds that is a reminder for those who remember
11|115|and be patient for indeed allah does not allow to be lost the reward of those who do good
11|116|so why were there not among the generations before you those of enduring discrimination forbidding corruption on earth except a few of those we saved from among them but those who wronged pursued what luxury they were given therein and they were criminals
11|117|and your lord would not have destroyed the cities unjustly while their people were reformers
11|118|and if your lord had willed he could have made mankind one community but they will not cease to differ
11|119|except whom your lord has given mercy and for that he created them but the word of your lord is to be fulfilled that i will surely fill hell with jinn and men all together
11|120|and each story we relate to you from the news of the messengers is that by which we make firm your heart and there has come to you in this the truth and an instruction and a reminder for the believers
11|121|and say to those who do not believe work according to your position indeed we are working
11|122|and wait indeed we are waiting
11|123|and to allah belong the unseen aspects of the heavens and the earth and to him will be returned the matter all of it so worship him and rely upon him and your lord is not unaware of that which you do
12|1|alif lam ra these are the verses of the clear book
12|2|indeed we have sent it down as an arabic qur an that you might understand
12|3|we relate to you o muhammad the best of stories in what we have revealed to you of this qur an although you were before it among the unaware
12|4|of these stories mention when joseph said to his father o my father indeed i have seen in a dream eleven stars and the sun and the moon i saw them prostrating to me
12|5|he said o my son do not relate your vision to your brothers or they will contrive against you a plan indeed satan to man is a manifest enemy
12|6|and thus will your lord choose you and teach you the interpretation of narratives and complete his favor upon you and upon the family of jacob as he completed it upon your fathers before abraham and isaac indeed your lord is knowing and wise
12|7|certainly were there in joseph and his brothers signs for those who ask
12|8|when they said joseph and his brother are more beloved to our father than we while we are a clan indeed our father is in clear error
12|9|kill joseph or cast him out to another land the countenance of your father will then be only for you and you will be after that a righteous people
12|10|said a speaker among them do not kill joseph but throw him into the bottom of the well some travelers will pick him up if you would do something
12|11|they said o our father why do you not entrust us with joseph while indeed we are to him sincere counselors
12|12|send him with us tomorrow that he may eat well and play and indeed we will be his guardians
12|13|jacob said indeed it saddens me that you should take him and i fear that a wolf would eat him while you are of him unaware
12|14|they said if a wolf should eat him while we are a strong clan indeed we would then be losers
12|15|so when they took him out and agreed to put him into the bottom of the well but we inspired to him you will surely inform them someday about this affair of theirs while they do not perceive your identity
12|16|and they came to their father at night weeping
12|17|they said o our father indeed we went racing each other and left joseph with our possessions and a wolf ate him but you would not believe us even if we were truthful
12|18|and they brought upon his shirt false blood jacob said rather your souls have enticed you to something so patience is most fitting and allah is the one sought for help against that which you describe
12|19|and there came a company of travelers then they sent their water drawer and he let down his bucket he said good news here is a boy and they concealed him taking him as merchandise and allah was knowing of what they did
12|20|and they sold him for a reduced price a few dirhams and they were concerning him of those content with little
12|21|and the one from egypt who bought him said to his wife make his residence comfortable perhaps he will benefit us or we will adopt him as a son and thus we established joseph in the land that we might teach him the interpretation of events and allah is predominant over his affair but most of the people do not know
12|22|and when joseph reached maturity we gave him judgment and knowledge and thus we reward the doers of good
12|23|and she in whose house he was sought to seduce him she closed the doors and said come you he said i seek the refuge of allah indeed he is my master who has made good my residence indeed wrongdoers will not succeed
12|24|and she certainly determined to seduce him and he would have inclined to her had he not seen the proof of his lord and thus it was that we should avert from him evil and immorality indeed he was of our chosen servants
12|25|and they both raced to the door and she tore his shirt from the back and they found her husband at the door she said what is the recompense of one who intended evil for your wife but that he be imprisoned or a painful punishment
12|26|joseph said it was she who sought to seduce me and a witness from her family testified if his shirt is torn from the front then she has told the truth and he is of the liars
12|27|but if his shirt is torn from the back then she has lied and he is of the truthful
12|28|so when her husband saw his shirt torn from the back he said indeed it is of the women s plan indeed your plan is great
12|29|joseph ignore this and my wife ask forgiveness for your sin indeed you were of the sinful
12|30|and women in the city said the wife of al azeez is seeking to seduce her slave boy he has impassioned her with love indeed we see her to be in clear error
12|31|so when she heard of their scheming she sent for them and prepared for them a banquet and gave each one of them a knife and said to joseph come out before them and when they saw him they greatly admired him and cut their hands and said perfect is allah this is not a man this is none but a noble angel
12|32|she said that is the one about whom you blamed me and i certainly sought to seduce him but he firmly refused and if he will not do what i order him he will surely be imprisoned and will be of those debased
12|33|he said my lord prison is more to my liking than that to which they invite me and if you do not avert from me their plan i might incline toward them and thus be of the ignorant
12|34|so his lord responded to him and averted from him their plan indeed he is the hearing the knowing
12|35|then it appeared to them after they had seen the signs that al azeez should surely imprison him for a time
12|36|and there entered the prison with him two young men one of them said indeed i have seen myself in a dream pressing wine the other said indeed i have seen myself carrying upon my head some bread from which the birds were eating inform us of its interpretation indeed we see you to be of those who do good
12|37|he said you will not receive food that is provided to you except that i will inform you of its interpretation before it comes to you that is from what my lord has taught me indeed i have left the religion of a people who do not believe in allah and they in the hereafter are disbelievers
12|38|and i have followed the religion of my fathers abraham isaac and jacob and it was not for us to associate anything with allah that is from the favor of allah upon us and upon the people but most of the people are not grateful
12|39|o my two companions of prison are separate lords better or allah the one the prevailing
12|40|you worship not besides him except mere names you have named them you and your fathers for which allah has sent down no authority legislation is not but for allah he has commanded that you worship not except him that is the correct religion but most of the people do not know
12|41|o two companions of prison as for one of you he will give drink to his master of wine but as for the other he will be crucified and the birds will eat from his head the matter has been decreed about which you both inquire
12|42|and he said to the one whom he knew would go free mention me before your master but satan made him forget the mention to his master and joseph remained in prison several years
12|43|and subsequently the king said indeed i have seen in a dream seven fat cows being eaten by seven that were lean and seven green spikes of grain and others that were dry o eminent ones explain to me my vision if you should interpret visions
12|44|they said it is but a mixture of false dreams and we are not learned in the interpretation of dreams
12|45|but the one who was freed and remembered after a time said i will inform you of its interpretation so send me forth
12|46|he said joseph o man of truth explain to us about seven fat cows eaten by seven that were lean and seven green spikes of grain and others that were dry that i may return to the people perhaps they will know about you
12|47|joseph said you will plant for seven years consecutively and what you harvest leave in its spikes except a little from which you will eat
12|48|then will come after that seven difficult years which will consume what you saved for them except a little from which you will store
12|49|then will come after that a year in which the people will be given rain and in which they will press olives and grapes
12|50|and the king said bring him to me but when the messenger came to him joseph said return to your master and ask him what is the case of the women who cut their hands indeed my lord is knowing of their plan
12|51|said the king to the women what was your condition when you sought to seduce joseph they said perfect is allah we know about him no evil the wife of al azeez said now the truth has become evident it was i who sought to seduce him and indeed he is of the truthful
12|52|that is so al azeez will know that i did not betray him in his absence and that allah does not guide the plan of betrayers
12|53|and i do not acquit myself indeed the soul is a persistent enjoiner of evil except those upon which my lord has mercy indeed my lord is forgiving and merciful
12|54|and the king said bring him to me i will appoint him exclusively for myself and when he spoke to him he said indeed you are today established in position and trusted
12|55|joseph said appoint me over the storehouses of the land indeed i will be a knowing guardian
12|56|and thus we established joseph in the land to settle therein wherever he willed we touch with our mercy whom we will and we do not allow to be lost the reward of those who do good
12|57|and the reward of the hereafter is better for those who believed and were fearing allah
12|58|and the brothers of joseph came seeking food and they entered upon him and he recognized them but he was to them unknown
12|59|and when he had furnished them with their supplies he said bring me a brother of yours from your father do not you see that i give full measure and that i am the best of accommodators
12|60|but if you do not bring him to me no measure will there be hereafter for you from me nor will you approach me
12|61|they said we will attempt to dissuade his father from keeping him and indeed we will do it
12|62|and joseph said to his servants put their merchandise into their saddlebags so they might recognize it when they have gone back to their people that perhaps they will again return
12|63|so when they returned to their father they said o our father further measure has been denied to us so send with us our brother that we will be given measure and indeed we will be his guardians
12|64|he said should i entrust you with him except under coercion as i entrusted you with his brother before but allah is the best guardian and he is the most merciful of the merciful
12|65|and when they opened their baggage they found their merchandise returned to them they said o our father what more could we desire this is our merchandise returned to us and we will obtain supplies for our family and protect our brother and obtain an increase of a camel s load that is an easy measurement
12|66|jacob said never will i send him with you until you give me a promise by allah that you will bring him back to me unless you should be surrounded by enemies and when they had given their promise he said allah over what we say is witness
12|67|and he said o my sons do not enter from one gate but enter from different gates and i cannot avail you against the decree of allah at all the decision is only for allah upon him i have relied and upon him let those who would rely indeed rely
12|68|and when they entered from where their father had ordered them it did not avail them against allah at all except it was a need within the soul of jacob which he satisfied and indeed he was a possessor of knowledge because of what we had taught him but most of the people do not know
12|69|and when they entered upon joseph he took his brother to himself he said indeed i am your brother so do not despair over what they used to do to me
12|70|so when he had furnished them with their supplies he put the gold measuring bowl into the bag of his brother then an announcer called out o caravan indeed you are thieves
12|71|they said while approaching them what is it you are missing
12|72|they said we are missing the measure of the king and for he who produces it is the reward of a camel s load and i am responsible for it
12|73|they said by allah you have certainly known that we did not come to cause corruption in the land and we have not been thieves
12|74|the accusers said then what would be its recompense if you should be liars
12|75|the brothers said its recompense is that he in whose bag it is found he himself will be its recompense thus do we recompense the wrongdoers
12|76|so he began the search with their bags before the bag of his brother then he extracted it from the bag of his brother thus did we plan for joseph he could not have taken his brother within the religion of the king except that allah willed we raise in degrees whom we will but over every possessor of knowledge is one more knowing
12|77|they said if he steals a brother of his has stolen before but joseph kept it within himself and did not reveal it to them he said you are worse in position and allah is most knowing of what you describe
12|78|they said o azeez indeed he has a father who is an old man so take one of us in place of him indeed we see you as a doer of good
12|79|he said i seek the refuge of allah to prevent that we take except him with whom we found our possession indeed we would then be unjust
12|80|so when they had despaired of him they secluded themselves in private consultation the eldest of them said do you not know that your father has taken upon you an oath by allah and that before you failed in your duty to joseph so i will never leave this land until my father permits me or allah decides for me and he is the best of judges
12|81|return to your father and say o our father indeed your son has stolen and we did not testify except to what we knew and we were not witnesses of the unseen
12|82|and ask the city in which we were and the caravan in which we came and indeed we are truthful
12|83|jacob said rather your souls have enticed you to something so patience is most fitting perhaps allah will bring them to me all together indeed it is he who is the knowing the wise
12|84|and he turned away from them and said oh my sorrow over joseph and his eyes became white from grief for he was of that a suppressor
12|85|they said by allah you will not cease remembering joseph until you become fatally ill or become of those who perish
12|86|he said i only complain of my suffering and my grief to allah and i know from allah that which you do not know
12|87|o my sons go and find out about joseph and his brother and despair not of relief from allah indeed no one despairs of relief from allah except the disbelieving people
12|88|so when they entered upon joseph they said o azeez adversity has touched us and our family and we have come with goods poor in quality but give us full measure and be charitable to us indeed allah rewards the charitable
12|89|he said do you know what you did with joseph and his brother when you were ignorant
12|90|they said are you indeed joseph he said i am joseph and this is my brother allah has certainly favored us indeed he who fears allah and is patient then indeed allah does not allow to be lost the reward of those who do good
12|91|they said by allah certainly has allah preferred you over us and indeed we have been sinners
12|92|he said no blame will there be upon you today allah will forgive you and he is the most merciful of the merciful
12|93|take this my shirt and cast it over the face of my father he will become seeing and bring me your family all together
12|94|and when the caravan departed from egypt their father said indeed i find the smell of joseph and would say that he was alive if you did not think me weakened in mind
12|95|they said by allah indeed you are in your same old error
12|96|and when the bearer of good tidings arrived he cast it over his face and he returned once again seeing he said did i not tell you that i know from allah that which you do not know
12|97|they said o our father ask for us forgiveness of our sins indeed we have been sinners
12|98|he said i will ask forgiveness for you from my lord indeed it is he who is the forgiving the merciful
12|99|and when they entered upon joseph he took his parents to himself and said enter egypt allah willing safe and secure
12|100|and he raised his parents upon the throne and they bowed to him in prostration and he said o my father this is the explanation of my vision of before my lord has made it reality and he was certainly good to me when he took me out of prison and brought you here from bedouin life after satan had induced estrangement between me and my brothers indeed my lord is subtle in what he wills indeed it is he who is the knowing the wise
12|101|my lord you have given me something of sovereignty and taught me of the interpretation of dreams creator of the heavens and earth you are my protector in this world and in the hereafter cause me to die a muslim and join me with the righteous
12|102|that is from the news of the unseen which we reveal o muhammad to you and you were not with them when they put together their plan while they conspired
12|103|and most of the people although you strive for it are not believers
12|104|and you do not ask of them for it any payment it is not except a reminder to the worlds
12|105|and how many a sign within the heavens and earth do they pass over while they therefrom are turning away
12|106|and most of them believe not in allah except while they associate others with him
12|107|then do they feel secure that there will not come to them an overwhelming aspect of the punishment of allah or that the hour will not come upon them suddenly while they do not perceive
12|108|say this is my way i invite to allah with insight i and those who follow me and exalted is allah and i am not of those who associate others with him
12|109|and we sent not before you as messengers except men to whom we revealed from among the people of cities so have they not traveled through the earth and observed how was the end of those before them and the home of the hereafter is best for those who fear allah then will you not reason
12|110|they continued until when the messengers despaired and were certain that they had been denied there came to them our victory and whoever we willed was saved and our punishment cannot be repelled from the people who are criminals
12|111|there was certainly in their stories a lesson for those of understanding never was the qur an a narration invented but a confirmation of what was before it and a detailed explanation of all things and guidance and mercy for a people who believe
13|1|alif lam meem ra these are the verses of the book and what has been revealed to you from your lord is the truth but most of the people do not believe
13|2|it is allah who erected the heavens without pillars that you can see then he established himself above the throne and made subject the sun and the moon each running its course for a specified term he arranges each matter he details the signs that you may of the meeting with your lord be certain
13|3|and it is he who spread the earth and placed therein firmly set mountains and rivers and from all of the fruits he made therein two mates he causes the night to cover the day indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought
13|4|and within the land are neighboring plots and gardens of grapevines and crops and palm trees growing several from a root or otherwise watered with one water but we make some of them exceed others in quality of fruit indeed in that are signs for a people who reason
13|5|and if you are astonished o muhammad then astonishing is their saying when we are dust will we indeed be brought into a new creation those are the ones who have disbelieved in their lord and those will have shackles upon their necks and those are the companions of the fire they will abide therein eternally
13|6|they impatiently urge you to bring about evil before good while there has already occurred before them similar punishments to what they demand and indeed your lord is full of forgiveness for the people despite their wrongdoing and indeed your lord is severe in penalty
13|7|and those who disbelieved say why has a sign not been sent down to him from his lord you are only a warner and for every people is a guide
13|8|allah knows what every female carries and what the wombs lose prematurely or exceed and everything with him is by due measure
13|9|he is knower of the unseen and the witnessed the grand the exalted
13|10|it is the same to him concerning you whether one conceals his speech or one publicizes it and whether one is hidden by night or conspicuous among others by day
13|11|for each one are successive angels before and behind him who protect him by the decree of allah indeed allah will not change the condition of a people until they change what is in themselves and when allah intends for a people ill there is no repelling it and there is not for them besides him any patron
13|12|it is he who shows you lightening causing fear and aspiration and generates the heavy clouds
13|13|and the thunder exalts allah with praise of him and the angels as well from fear of him and he sends thunderbolts and strikes therewith whom he wills while they dispute about allah and he is severe in assault
13|14|to him alone is the supplication of truth and those they call upon besides him do not respond to them with a thing except as one who stretches his hands toward water from afar calling it to reach his mouth but it will not reach it thus and the supplication of the disbelievers is not but in error i e futility
13|15|and to allah prostrates whoever is within the heavens and the earth willingly or by compulsion and their shadows as well in the mornings and the afternoons
13|16|say who is lord of the heavens and earth say allah say have you then taken besides him allies not possessing even for themselves any benefit or any harm say is the blind equivalent to the seeing or is darkness equivalent to light or have they attributed to allah partners who created like his creation so that the creation of each seemed similar to them say allah is the creator of all things and he is the one the prevailing
13|17|he sends down from the sky rain and valleys flow according to their capacity and the torrent carries a rising foam and from that ore which they heat in the fire desiring adornments and utensils is a foam like it thus allah presents the example of truth and falsehood as for the foam it vanishes being cast off but as for that which benefits the people it remains on the earth thus does allah present examples
13|18|for those who have responded to their lord is the best reward but those who did not respond to him if they had all that is in the earth entirely and the like of it with it they would attempt to ransom themselves thereby those will have the worst account and their refuge is hell and wretched is the resting place
13|19|then is he who knows that what has been revealed to you from your lord is the truth like one who is blind they will only be reminded who are people of understanding
13|20|those who fulfill the covenant of allah and do not break the contract
13|21|and those who join that which allah has ordered to be joined and fear their lord and are afraid of the evil of their account
13|22|and those who are patient seeking the countenance of their lord and establish prayer and spend from what we have provided for them secretly and publicly and prevent evil with good those will have the good consequence of this home
13|23|gardens of perpetual residence they will enter them with whoever were righteous among their fathers their spouses and their descendants and the angels will enter upon them from every gate saying
13|24|peace be upon you for what you patiently endured and excellent is the final home
13|25|but those who break the covenant of allah after contracting it and sever that which allah has ordered to be joined and spread corruption on earth for them is the curse and they will have the worst home
13|26|allah extends provision for whom he wills and restricts it and they rejoice in the worldly life while the worldly life is not compared to the hereafter except brief enjoyment
13|27|and those who disbelieved say why has a sign not been sent down to him from his lord say o muhammad indeed allah leaves astray whom he wills and guides to himself whoever turns back to him
13|28|those who have believed and whose hearts are assured by the remembrance of allah unquestionably by the remembrance of allah hearts are assured
13|29|those who have believed and done righteous deeds a good state is theirs and a good return
13|30|thus have we sent you to a community before which other communities have passed on so you might recite to them that which we revealed to you while they disbelieve in the most merciful say he is my lord there is no deity except him upon him i rely and to him is my return
13|31|and if there was any qur an by which the mountains would be removed or the earth would be broken apart or the dead would be made to speak it would be this qur an but to allah belongs the affair entirely then have those who believed not accepted that had allah willed he would have guided the people all of them and those who disbelieve do not cease to be struck for what they have done by calamity or it will descend near their home until there comes the promise of allah indeed allah does not fail in his promise
13|32|and already were other messengers ridiculed before you and i extended the time of those who disbelieved then i seized them and how terrible was my penalty
13|33|then is he who is a maintainer of every soul knowing what it has earned like any other but to allah they have attributed partners say name them or do you inform him of that which he knows not upon the earth or of what is apparent of speech rather their own plan has been made attractive to those who disbelieve and they have been averted from the way and whomever allah leaves astray there will be for him no guide
13|34|for them will be punishment in the life of this world and the punishment of the hereafter is more severe and they will not have from allah any protector
13|35|the example of paradise which the righteous have been promised is that beneath it rivers flow its fruit is lasting and its shade that is the consequence for the righteous and the consequence for the disbelievers is the fire
13|36|and the believers among those to whom we have given the previous scripture rejoice at what has been revealed to you o muhammad but among the opposing factions are those who deny part of it say i have only been commanded to worship allah and not associate anything with him to him i invite and to him is my return
13|37|and thus we have revealed it as an arabic legislation and if you should follow their inclinations after what has come to you of knowledge you would not have against allah any ally or any protector
13|38|and we have already sent messengers before you and assigned to them wives and descendants and it was not for a messenger to come with a sign except by permission of allah for every term is a decree
13|39|allah eliminates what he wills or confirms and with him is the mother of the book
13|40|and whether we show you part of what we promise them or take you in death upon you is only the duty of notification and upon us is the account
13|41|have they not seen that we set upon the land reducing it from its borders and allah decides there is no adjuster of his decision and he is swift in account
13|42|and those before them had plotted but to allah belongs the plan entirely he knows what every soul earns and the disbelievers will know for whom is the final home
13|43|and those who have disbelieved say you are not a messenger say o muhammad sufficient is allah as witness between me and you and the witness of whoever has knowledge of the scripture
14|1|alif lam ra this is a book which we have revealed to you o muhammad that you might bring mankind out of darknesses into the light by permission of their lord to the path of the exalted in might the praiseworthy
14|2|allah to whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth and woe to the disbelievers from a severe punishment
14|3|the ones who prefer the worldly life over the hereafter and avert people from the way of allah seeking to make it seem deviant those are in extreme error
14|4|and we did not send any messenger except speaking in the language of his people to state clearly for them and allah sends astray thereby whom he wills and guides whom he wills and he is the exalted in might the wise
14|5|and we certainly sent moses with our signs saying bring out your people from darknesses into the light and remind them of the days of allah indeed in that are signs for everyone patient and grateful
14|6|and recall o children of israel when moses said to his people remember the favor of allah upon you when he saved you from the people of pharaoh who were afflicting you with the worst torment and were slaughtering your newborn sons and keeping your females alive and in that was a great trial from your lord
14|7|and remember when your lord proclaimed if you are grateful i will surely increase you in favor but if you deny indeed my punishment is severe
14|8|and moses said if you should disbelieve you and whoever is on the earth entirely indeed allah is free of need and praiseworthy
14|9|has there not reached you the news of those before you the people of noah and aad and thamud and those after them no one knows them but allah their messengers brought them clear proofs but they returned their hands to their mouths and said indeed we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent and indeed we are about that to which you invite us in disquieting doubt
14|10|their messengers said can there be doubt about allah creator of the heavens and earth he invites you that he may forgive you of your sins and he delays your death for a specified term they said you are not but men like us who wish to avert us from what our fathers were worshipping so bring us a clear authority
14|11|their messengers said to them we are only men like you but allah confers favor upon whom he wills of his servants it has never been for us to bring you evidence except by permission of allah and upon allah let the believers rely
14|12|and why should we not rely upon allah while he has guided us to our good ways and we will surely be patient against whatever harm you should cause us and upon allah let those who would rely indeed rely
14|13|and those who disbelieved said to their messengers we will surely drive you out of our land or you must return to our religion so their lord inspired to them we will surely destroy the wrongdoers
14|14|and we will surely cause you to dwell in the land after them that is for he who fears my position and fears my threat
14|15|and they requested victory from allah and disappointed therefore was every obstinate tyrant
14|16|before him is hell and he will be given a drink of purulent water
14|17|he will gulp it but will hardly be able to swallow it and death will come to him from everywhere but he is not to die and before him is a massive punishment
14|18|the example of those who disbelieve in their lord is that their deeds are like ashes which the wind blows forcefully on a stormy day they are unable to keep from what they earned a single thing that is what is extreme error
14|19|have you not seen that allah created the heavens and the earth in truth if he wills he can do away with you and produce a new creation
14|20|and that is not difficult for allah
14|21|and they will come out for judgement before allah all together and the weak will say to those who were arrogant indeed we were your followers so can you avail us anything against the punishment of allah they will say if allah had guided us we would have guided you it is all the same for us whether we show intolerance or are patient there is for us no place of escape
14|22|and satan will say when the matter has been concluded indeed allah had promised you the promise of truth and i promised you but i betrayed you but i had no authority over you except that i invited you and you responded to me so do not blame me but blame yourselves i cannot be called to your aid nor can you be called to my aid indeed i deny your association of me with allah before indeed for the wrongdoers is a painful punishment
14|23|and those who believed and did righteous deeds will be admitted to gardens beneath which rivers flow abiding eternally therein by permission of their lord and their greeting therein will be peace
14|24|have you not considered how allah presents an example making a good word like a good tree whose root is firmly fixed and its branches high in the sky
14|25|it produces its fruit all the time by permission of its lord and allah presents examples for the people that perhaps they will be reminded
14|26|and the example of a bad word is like a bad tree uprooted from the surface of the earth not having any stability
14|27|allah keeps firm those who believe with the firm word in worldly life and in the hereafter and allah sends astray the wrongdoers and allah does what he wills
14|28|have you not considered those who exchanged the favor of allah for disbelief and settled their people in the home of ruin
14|29|it is hell which they will enter to burn and wretched is the settlement
14|30|and they have attributed to allah equals to mislead people from his way say enjoy yourselves for indeed your destination is the fire
14|31|o muhammad tell my servants who have believed to establish prayer and spend from what we have provided them secretly and publicly before a day comes in which there will be no exchange nor any friendships
14|32|it is allah who created the heavens and the earth and sent down rain from the sky and produced thereby some fruits as provision for you and subjected for you the ships to sail through the sea by his command and subjected for you the rivers
14|33|and he subjected for you the sun and the moon continuous in orbit and subjected for you the night and the day
14|34|and he gave you from all you asked of him and if you should count the favor of allah you could not enumerate them indeed mankind is generally most unjust and ungrateful
14|35|and mention o muhammad when abraham said my lord make this city makkah secure and keep me and my sons away from worshipping idols
14|36|my lord indeed they have led astray many among the people so whoever follows me then he is of me and whoever disobeys me indeed you are yet forgiving and merciful
14|37|our lord i have settled some of my descendants in an uncultivated valley near your sacred house our lord that they may establish prayer so make hearts among the people incline toward them and provide for them from the fruits that they might be grateful
14|38|our lord indeed you know what we conceal and what we declare and nothing is hidden from allah on the earth or in the heaven
14|39|praise to allah who has granted to me in old age ishmael and isaac indeed my lord is the hearer of supplication
14|40|my lord make me an establisher of prayer and many from my descendants our lord and accept my supplication
14|41|our lord forgive me and my parents and the believers the day the account is established
14|42|and never think that allah is unaware of what the wrongdoers do he only delays them for a day when eyes will stare in horror
14|43|racing ahead their heads raised up their glance does not come back to them and their hearts are void
14|44|and o muhammad warn the people of a day when the punishment will come to them and those who did wrong will say our lord delay us for a short term we will answer your call and follow the messengers but it will be said had you not sworn before that for you there would be no cessation
14|45|and you lived among the dwellings of those who wronged themselves and it had become clear to you how we dealt with them and we presented for you many examples
14|46|and they had planned their plan but with allah is recorded their plan even if their plan had been sufficient to do away with the mountains
14|47|so never think that allah will fail in his promise to his messengers indeed allah is exalted in might and owner of retribution
14|48|it will be on the day the earth will be replaced by another earth and the heavens as well and all creatures will come out before allah the one the prevailing
14|49|and you will see the criminals that day bound together in shackles
14|50|their garments of liquid pitch and their faces covered by the fire
14|51|so that allah will recompense every soul for what it earned indeed allah is swift in account
14|52|this qur an is notification for the people that they may be warned thereby and that they may know that he is but one god and that those of understanding will be reminded
15|1|alif lam ra these are the verses of the book and a clear qur an
15|2|perhaps those who disbelieve will wish that they had been muslims
15|3|let them eat and enjoy themselves and be diverted by false hope for they are going to know
15|4|and we did not destroy any city but that for it was a known decree
15|5|no nation will precede its term nor will they remain thereafter
15|6|and they say o you upon whom the message has been sent down indeed you are mad
15|7|why do you not bring us the angels if you should be among the truthful
15|8|we do not send down the angels except with truth and the disbelievers would not then be reprieved
15|9|indeed it is we who sent down the qur an and indeed we will be its guardian
15|10|and we had certainly sent messengers before you o muhammad among the sects of the former peoples
15|11|and no messenger would come to them except that they ridiculed him
15|12|thus do we insert denial into the hearts of the criminals
15|13|they will not believe in it while there has already occurred the precedent of the former peoples
15|14|and even if we opened to them a gate from the heaven and they continued therein to ascend
15|15|they would say our eyes have only been dazzled rather we are a people affected by magic
15|16|and we have placed within the heaven great stars and have beautified it for the observers
15|17|and we have protected it from every devil expelled from the mercy of allah
15|18|except one who steals a hearing and is pursued by a clear burning flame
15|19|and the earth we have spread it and cast therein firmly set mountains and caused to grow therein something of every well balanced thing
15|20|and we have made for you therein means of living and for those for whom you are not providers
15|21|and there is not a thing but that with us are its depositories and we do not send it down except according to a known measure
15|22|and we have sent the fertilizing winds and sent down water from the sky and given you drink from it and you are not its retainers
15|23|and indeed it is we who give life and cause death and we are the inheritor
15|24|and we have already known the preceding generations among you and we have already known the later ones to come
15|25|and indeed your lord will gather them indeed he is wise and knowing
15|26|and we did certainly create man out of clay from an altered black mud
15|27|and the jinn we created before from scorching fire
15|28|and mention o muhammad when your lord said to the angels i will create a human being out of clay from an altered black mud
15|29|and when i have proportioned him and breathed into him of my created soul then fall down to him in prostration
15|30|so the angels prostrated all of them entirely
15|31|except iblees he refused to be with those who prostrated
15|32|allah said o iblees what is the matter with you that you are not with those who prostrate
15|33|he said never would i prostrate to a human whom you created out of clay from an altered black mud
15|34|allah said then get out of it for indeed you are expelled
15|35|and indeed upon you is the curse until the day of recompense
15|36|he said my lord then reprieve me until the day they are resurrected
15|37|allah said so indeed you are of those reprieved
15|38|until the day of the time well known
15|39|iblees said my lord because you have put me in error i will surely make disobedience attractive to them on earth and i will mislead them all
15|40|except among them your chosen servants
15|41|allah said this is a path of return to me that is straight
15|42|indeed my servants no authority will you have over them except those who follow you of the deviators
15|43|and indeed hell is the promised place for them all
15|44|it has seven gates for every gate is of them a portion designated
15|45|indeed the righteous will be within gardens and springs
15|46|having been told enter it in peace safe and secure
15|47|and we will remove whatever is in their breasts of resentment so they will be brothers on thrones facing each other
15|48|no fatigue will touch them therein nor from it will they ever be removed
15|49|o muhammad inform my servants that it is i who am the forgiving the merciful
15|50|and that it is my punishment which is the painful punishment
15|51|and inform them about the guests of abraham
15|52|when they entered upon him and said peace abraham said indeed we are fearful of you
15|53|the angels said fear not indeed we give you good tidings of a learned boy
15|54|he said have you given me good tidings although old age has come upon me then of what wonder do you inform
15|55|they said we have given you good tidings in truth so do not be of the despairing
15|56|he said and who despairs of the mercy of his lord except for those astray
15|57|abraham said then what is your business here o messengers
15|58|they said indeed we have been sent to a people of criminals
15|59|except the family of lot indeed we will save them all
15|60|except his wife allah decreed that she is of those who remain behind
15|61|and when the messengers came to the family of lot
15|62|he said indeed you are people unknown
15|63|they said but we have come to you with that about which they were disputing
15|64|and we have come to you with truth and indeed we are truthful
15|65|so set out with your family during a portion of the night and follow behind them and let not anyone among you look back and continue on to where you are commanded
15|66|and we conveyed to him the decree of that matter that those sinners would be eliminated by early morning
15|67|and the people of the city came rejoicing
15|68|lot said indeed these are my guests so do not shame me
15|69|and fear allah and do not disgrace me
15|70|they said have we not forbidden you from protecting people
15|71|lot said these are my daughters if you would be doers of lawful marriage
15|72|by your life o muhammad indeed they were in their intoxication wandering blindly
15|73|so the shriek seized them at sunrise
15|74|and we made the highest part of the city its lowest and rained upon them stones of hard clay
15|75|indeed in that are signs for those who discern
15|76|and indeed those cities are situated on an established road
15|77|indeed in that is a sign for the believers
15|78|and the companions of the thicket were also wrongdoers
15|79|so we took retribution from them and indeed both cities are on a clear highway
15|80|and certainly did the companions of thamud deny the messengers
15|81|and we gave them our signs but from them they were turning away
15|82|and they used to carve from the mountains houses feeling secure
15|83|but the shriek seized them at early morning
15|84|so nothing availed them from what they used to earn
15|85|and we have not created the heavens and earth and that between them except in truth and indeed the hour is coming so forgive with gracious forgiveness
15|86|indeed your lord he is the knowing creator
15|87|and we have certainly given you o muhammad seven of the often repeated verses and the great qur an
15|88|do not extend your eyes toward that by which we have given enjoyment to certain categories of the disbelievers and do not grieve over them and lower your wing to the believers
15|89|and say indeed i am the clear warner
15|90|just as we had revealed scriptures to the separators
15|91|who have made the qur an into portions
15|92|so by your lord we will surely question them all
15|93|about what they used to do
15|94|then declare what you are commanded and turn away from the polytheists
15|95|indeed we are sufficient for you against the mockers
15|96|who make equal with allah another deity but they are going to know
15|97|and we already know that your breast is constrained by what they say
15|98|so exalt allah with praise of your lord and be of those who prostrate to him
15|99|and worship your lord until there comes to you the certainty death
16|1|the command of allah is coming so be not impatient for it exalted is he and high above what they associate with him
16|2|he sends down the angels with the inspiration of his command upon whom he wills of his servants telling them warn that there is no deity except me so fear me
16|3|he created the heavens and earth in truth high is he above what they associate with him
16|4|he created man from a sperm drop then at once he is a clear adversary
16|5|and the grazing livestock he has created for you in them is warmth and numerous benefits and from them you eat
16|6|and for you in them is the enjoyment of beauty when you bring them in for the evening and when you send them out to pasture
16|7|and they carry your loads to a land you could not have reached except with difficulty to yourselves indeed your lord is kind and merciful
16|8|and he created the horses mules and donkeys for you to ride and as adornment and he creates that which you do not know
16|9|and upon allah is the direction of the right way and among the various paths are those deviating and if he willed he could have guided you all
16|10|it is he who sends down rain from the sky from it is drink and from it is foliage in which you pasture animals
16|11|he causes to grow for you thereby the crops olives palm trees grapevines and from all the fruits indeed in that is a sign for a people who give thought
16|12|and he has subjected for you the night and day and the sun and moon and the stars are subjected by his command indeed in that are signs for a people who reason
16|13|and he has subjected whatever he multiplied for you on the earth of varying colors indeed in that is a sign for a people who remember
16|14|and it is he who subjected the sea for you to eat from it tender meat and to extract from it ornaments which you wear and you see the ships plowing through it and he subjected it that you may seek of his bounty and perhaps you will be grateful
16|15|and he has cast into the earth firmly set mountains lest it shift with you and made rivers and roads that you may be guided
16|16|and landmarks and by the stars they are also guided
16|17|then is he who creates like one who does not create so will you not be reminded
16|18|and if you should count the favors of allah you could not enumerate them indeed allah is forgiving and merciful
16|19|and allah knows what you conceal and what you declare
16|20|and those they invoke other than allah create nothing and they themselves are created
16|21|they are in fact dead not alive and they do not perceive when they will be resurrected
16|22|your god is one god but those who do not believe in the hereafter their hearts are disapproving and they are arrogant
16|23|assuredly allah knows what they conceal and what they declare indeed he does not like the arrogant
16|24|and when it is said to them what has your lord sent down they say legends of the former peoples
16|25|that they may bear their own burdens in full on the day of resurrection and some of the burdens of those whom they misguide without knowledge unquestionably evil is that which they bear
16|26|those before them had already plotted but allah came at their building from the foundations so the roof fell upon them from above them and the punishment came to them from where they did not perceive
16|27|then on the day of resurrection he will disgrace them and say where are my partners for whom you used to oppose the believers those who were given knowledge will say indeed disgrace this day and evil are upon the disbelievers
16|28|the ones whom the angels take in death while wronging themselves and who then offer submission saying we were not doing any evil but yes indeed allah is knowing of what you used to do
16|29|so enter the gates of hell to abide eternally therein and how wretched is the residence of the arrogant
16|30|and it will be said to those who feared allah what did your lord send down they will say that which is good for those who do good in this world is good and the home of the hereafter is better and how excellent is the home of the righteous
16|31|gardens of perpetual residence which they will enter beneath which rivers flow they will have therein whatever they wish thus does allah reward the righteous
16|32|the ones whom the angels take in death being good and pure the angels will say peace be upon you enter paradise for what you used to do
16|33|do the disbelievers await anything except that the angels should come to them or there comes the command of your lord thus did those do before them and allah wronged them not but they had been wronging themselves
16|34|so they were struck by the evil consequences of what they did and were enveloped by what they used to ridicule
16|35|and those who associate others with allah say if allah had willed we would not have worshipped anything other than him neither we nor our fathers nor would we have forbidden anything through other than him thus did those do before them so is there upon the messengers except the duty of clear notification
16|36|and we certainly sent into every nation a messenger saying worship allah and avoid taghut and among them were those whom allah guided and among them were those upon whom error was deservedly decreed so proceed through the earth and observe how was the end of the deniers
16|37|even if you should strive for their guidance o muhammad indeed allah does not guide those he sends astray and they will have no helpers
16|38|and they swear by allah their strongest oaths that allah will not resurrect one who dies but yes it is a true promise binding upon him but most of the people do not know
16|39|it is so he will make clear to them the truth of that wherein they differ and so those who have disbelieved may know that they were liars
16|40|indeed our word to a thing when we intend it is but that we say to it be and it is
16|41|and those who emigrated for the cause of allah after they had been wronged we will surely settle them in this world in a good place but the reward of the hereafter is greater if only they could know
16|42|they are those who endured patiently and upon their lord relied
16|43|and we sent not before you except men to whom we revealed our message so ask the people of the message if you do not know
16|44|we sent them with clear proofs and written ordinances and we revealed to you the message that you may make clear to the people what was sent down to them and that they might give thought
16|45|then do those who have planned evil deeds feel secure that allah will not cause the earth to swallow them or that the punishment will not come upon them from where they do not perceive
16|46|or that he would not seize them during their usual activity and they could not cause failure
16|47|or that he would not seize them gradually in a state of dread but indeed your lord is kind and merciful
16|48|have they not considered what things allah has created their shadows incline to the right and to the left prostrating to allah while they are humble
16|49|and to allah prostrates whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth of creatures and the angels as well and they are not arrogant
16|50|they fear their lord above them and they do what they are commanded
16|51|and allah has said do not take for yourselves two deities he is but one god so fear only me
16|52|and to him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth and to him is due worship constantly then is it other than allah that you fear
16|53|and whatever you have of favor it is from allah then when adversity touches you to him you cry for help
16|54|then when he removes the adversity from you at once a party of you associates others with their lord
16|55|so they will deny what we have given them then enjoy yourselves for you are going to know
16|56|and they assign to what they do not know a portion of that which we have provided them by allah you will surely be questioned about what you used to invent
16|57|and they attribute to allah daughters exalted is he and for them is what they desire
16|58|and when one of them is informed of the birth of a female his face becomes dark and he suppresses grief
16|59|he hides himself from the people because of the ill of which he has been informed should he keep it in humiliation or bury it in the ground unquestionably evil is what they decide
16|60|for those who do not believe in the hereafter is the description of evil and for allah is the highest attribute and he is exalted in might the wise
16|61|and if allah were to impose blame on the people for their wrongdoing he would not have left upon the earth any creature but he defers them for a specified term and when their term has come they will not remain behind an hour nor will they precede it
16|62|and they attribute to allah that which they dislike and their tongues assert the lie that they will have the best from him assuredly they will have the fire and they will be therein neglected
16|63|by allah we did certainly send messengers to nations before you but satan made their deeds attractive to them and he is the disbelievers ally today as well and they will have a painful punishment
16|64|and we have not revealed to you the book o muhammad except for you to make clear to them that wherein they have differed and as guidance and mercy for a people who believe
16|65|and allah has sent down rain from the sky and given life thereby to the earth after its lifelessness indeed in that is a sign for a people who listen
16|66|and indeed for you in grazing livestock is a lesson we give you drink from what is in their bellies between excretion and blood pure milk palatable to drinkers
16|67|and from the fruits of the palm trees and grapevines you take intoxicant and good provision indeed in that is a sign for a people who reason
16|68|and your lord inspired to the bee take for yourself among the mountains houses and among the trees and in that which they construct
16|69|then eat from all the fruits and follow the ways of your lord laid down for you there emerges from their bellies a drink varying in colors in which there is healing for people indeed in that is a sign for a people who give thought
16|70|and allah created you then he will take you in death and among you is he who is reversed to the most decrepit old age so that he will not know after having had knowledge a thing indeed allah is knowing and competent
16|71|and allah has favored some of you over others in provision but those who were favored would not hand over their provision to those whom their right hands possess so they would be equal to them therein then is it the favor of allah they reject
16|72|and allah has made for you from yourselves mates and has made for you from your mates sons and grandchildren and has provided for you from the good things then in falsehood do they believe and in the favor of allah they disbelieve
16|73|and they worship besides allah that which does not possess for them the power of provision from the heavens and the earth at all and in fact they are unable
16|74|so do not assert similarities to allah indeed allah knows and you do not know
16|75|allah presents an example a slave who is owned and unable to do a thing and he to whom we have provided from us good provision so he spends from it secretly and publicly can they be equal praise to allah but most of them do not know
16|76|and allah presents an example of two men one of them dumb and unable to do a thing while he is a burden to his guardian wherever he directs him he brings no good is he equal to one who commands justice while he is on a straight path
16|77|and to allah belongs the unseen aspects of the heavens and the earth and the command for the hour is not but as a glance of the eye or even nearer indeed allah is over all things competent
16|78|and allah has extracted you from the wombs of your mothers not knowing a thing and he made for you hearing and vision and intellect that perhaps you would be grateful
16|79|do they not see the birds controlled in the atmosphere of the sky none holds them up except allah indeed in that are signs for a people who believe
16|80|and allah has made for you from your homes a place of rest and made for you from the hides of the animals tents which you find light on your day of travel and your day of encampment and from their wool fur and hair is furnishing and enjoyment for a time
16|81|and allah has made for you from that which he has created shadows and has made for you from the mountains shelters and has made for you garments which protect you from the heat and garments which protect you from your enemy in battle thus does he complete his favor upon you that you might submit to him
16|82|but if they turn away o muhammad then only upon you is responsibility for clear notification
16|83|they recognize the favor of allah then they deny it and most of them are disbelievers
16|84|and mention the day when we will resurrect from every nation a witness then it will not be permitted to the disbelievers to apologize or make excuses nor will they be asked to appease allah
16|85|and when those who wronged see the punishment it will not be lightened for them nor will they be reprieved
16|86|and when those who associated others with allah see their partners they will say our lord these are our partners to you whom we used to invoke besides you but they will throw at them the statement indeed you are liars
16|87|and they will impart to allah that day their submission and lost from them is what they used to invent
16|88|those who disbelieved and averted others from the way of allah we will increase them in punishment over their punishment for what corruption they were causing
16|89|and mention the day when we will resurrect among every nation a witness over them from themselves and we will bring you o muhammad as a witness over your nation and we have sent down to you the book as clarification for all things and as guidance and mercy and good tidings for the muslims
16|90|indeed allah orders justice and good conduct and giving to relatives and forbids immorality and bad conduct and oppression he admonishes you that perhaps you will be reminded
16|91|and fulfill the covenant of allah when you have taken it o believers and do not break oaths after their confirmation while you have made allah over you a witness indeed allah knows what you do
16|92|and do not be like she who untwisted her spun thread after it was strong by taking your oaths as means of deceit between you because one community is more plentiful in number or wealth than another community allah only tries you thereby and he will surely make clear to you on the day of resurrection that over which you used to differ
16|93|and if allah had willed he could have made you of one religion but he causes to stray whom he wills and guides whom he wills and you will surely be questioned about what you used to do
16|94|and do not take your oaths as means of deceit between you lest a foot slip after it was once firm and you would taste evil in this world for what people you diverted from the way of allah and you would have in the hereafter a great punishment
16|95|and do not exchange the covenant of allah for a small price indeed what is with allah is best for you if only you could know
16|96|whatever you have will end but what allah has is lasting and we will surely give those who were patient their reward according to the best of what they used to do
16|97|whoever does righteousness whether male or female while he is a believer we will surely cause him to live a good life and we will surely give them their reward in the hereafter according to the best of what they used to do
16|98|so when you recite the qur an first seek refuge in allah from satan the expelled from his mercy
16|99|indeed there is for him no authority over those who have believed and rely upon their lord
16|100|his authority is only over those who take him as an ally and those who through him associate others with allah
16|101|and when we substitute a verse in place of a verse and allah is most knowing of what he sends down they say you o muhammad are but an inventor of lies but most of them do not know
16|102|say o muhammad the pure spirit has brought it down from your lord in truth to make firm those who believe and as guidance and good tidings to the muslims
16|103|and we certainly know that they say it is only a human being who teaches the prophet the tongue of the one they refer to is foreign and this qur an is in a clear arabic language
16|104|indeed those who do not believe in the verses of allah allah will not guide them and for them is a painful punishment
16|105|they only invent falsehood who do not believe in the verses of allah and it is those who are the liars
16|106|whoever disbelieves in allah after his belief except for one who is forced to renounce his religion while his heart is secure in faith but those who willingly open their breasts to disbelief upon them is wrath from allah and for them is a great punishment
16|107|that is because they preferred the worldly life over the hereafter and that allah does not guide the disbelieving people
16|108|those are the ones over whose hearts and hearing and vision allah has sealed and it is those who are the heedless
16|109|assuredly it is they in the hereafter who will be the losers
16|110|then indeed your lord to those who emigrated after they had been compelled to renounce their religion and thereafter fought for the cause of allah and were patient indeed your lord after that is forgiving and merciful
16|111|on the day when every soul will come disputing for itself and every soul will be fully compensated for what it did and they will not be wronged
16|112|and allah presents an example a city which was safe and secure its provision coming to it in abundance from every location but it denied the favors of allah so allah made it taste the envelopment of hunger and fear for what they had been doing
16|113|and there had certainly come to them a messenger from among themselves but they denied him so punishment overtook them while they were wrongdoers
16|114|then eat of what allah has provided for you which is lawful and good and be grateful for the favor of allah if it is indeed him that you worship
16|115|he has only forbidden to you dead animals blood the flesh of swine and that which has been dedicated to other than allah but whoever is forced by necessity neither desiring it nor transgressing its limit then indeed allah is forgiving and merciful
16|116|and do not say about what your tongues assert of untruth this is lawful and this is unlawful to invent falsehood about allah indeed those who invent falsehood about allah will not succeed
16|117|it is but a brief enjoyment and they will have a painful punishment
16|118|and to those who are jews we have prohibited that which we related to you before and we did not wrong them thereby but they were wronging themselves
16|119|then indeed your lord to those who have done wrong out of ignorance and then repent after that and correct themselves indeed your lord thereafter is forgiving and merciful
16|120|indeed abraham was a comprehensive leader devoutly obedient to allah inclining toward truth and he was not of those who associate others with allah
16|121|he was grateful for his favors allah chose him and guided him to a straight path
16|122|and we gave him good in this world and indeed in the hereafter he will be among the righteous
16|123|then we revealed to you o muhammad to follow the religion of abraham inclining toward truth and he was not of those who associate with allah
16|124|the sabbath was only appointed for those who differed over it and indeed your lord will judge between them on the day of resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ
16|125|invite to the way of your lord with wisdom and good instruction and argue with them in a way that is best indeed your lord is most knowing of who has strayed from his way and he is most knowing of who is rightly guided
16|126|and if you punish an enemy o believers punish with an equivalent of that with which you were harmed but if you are patient it is better for those who are patient
16|127|and be patient o muhammad and your patience is not but through allah and do not grieve over them and do not be in distress over what they conspire
16|128|indeed allah is with those who fear him and those who are doers of good
17|1|exalted is he who took his servant by night from al masjid al haram to al masjid al aqsa whose surroundings we have blessed to show him of our signs indeed he is the hearing the seeing
17|2|and we gave moses the scripture and made it a guidance for the children of israel that you not take other than me as disposer of affairs
17|3|o descendants of those we carried in the ship with noah indeed he was a grateful servant
17|4|and we conveyed to the children of israel in the scripture that you will surely cause corruption on the earth twice and you will surely reach a degree of great haughtiness
17|5|so when the time of promise came for the first of them we sent against you servants of ours those of great military might and they probed even into the homes and it was a promise fulfilled
17|6|then we gave back to you a return victory over them and we reinforced you with wealth and sons and made you more numerous in manpower
17|7|and said if you do good you do good for yourselves and if you do evil you do it to yourselves then when the final promise came we sent your enemies to sadden your faces and to enter the temple in jerusalem as they entered it the first time and to destroy what they had taken over with total destruction
17|8|then allah said it is expected if you repent that your lord will have mercy upon you but if you return to sin we will return to punishment and we have made hell for the disbelievers a prison bed
17|9|indeed this qur an guides to that which is most suitable and gives good tidings to the believers who do righteous deeds that they will have a great reward
17|10|and that those who do not believe in the hereafter we have prepared for them a painful punishment
17|11|and man supplicates for evil as he supplicates for good and man is ever hasty
17|12|and we have made the night and day two signs and we erased the sign of the night and made the sign of the day visible that you may seek bounty from your lord and may know the number of years and the account of time and everything we have set out in detail
17|13|and for every person we have imposed his fate upon his neck and we will produce for him on the day of resurrection a record which he will encounter spread open
17|14|it will be said read your record sufficient is yourself against you this day as accountant
17|15|whoever is guided is only guided for the benefit of his soul and whoever errs only errs against it and no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another and never would we punish until we sent a messenger
17|16|and when we intend to destroy a city we command its affluent but they defiantly disobey therein so the word comes into effect upon it and we destroy it with complete destruction
17|17|and how many have we destroyed from the generations after noah and sufficient is your lord concerning the sins of his servants as acquainted and seeing
17|18|whoever should desire the immediate we hasten for him from it what we will to whom we intend then we have made for him hell which he will enter to burn censured and banished
17|19|but whoever desires the hereafter and exerts the effort due to it while he is a believer it is those whose effort is ever appreciated by allah
17|20|to each category we extend to these and to those from the gift of your lord and never has the gift of your lord been restricted
17|21|look how we have favored in provision some of them over others but the hereafter is greater in degrees of difference and greater in distinction
17|22|do not make as equal with allah another deity and thereby become censured and forsaken
17|23|and your lord has decreed that you not worship except him and to parents good treatment whether one or both of them reach old age while with you say not to them so much as uff and do not repel them but speak to them a noble word
17|24|and lower to them the wing of humility out of mercy and say my lord have mercy upon them as they brought me up when i was small
17|25|your lord is most knowing of what is within yourselves if you should be righteous in intention then indeed he is ever to the often returning to him forgiving
17|26|and give the relative his right and also the poor and the traveler and do not spend wastefully
17|27|indeed the wasteful are brothers of the devils and ever has satan been to his lord ungrateful
17|28|and if you must turn away from the needy awaiting mercy from your lord which you expect then speak to them a gentle word
17|29|and do not make your hand as chained to your neck or extend it completely and thereby become blamed and insolvent
17|30|indeed your lord extends provision for whom he wills and restricts it indeed he is ever concerning his servants acquainted and seeing
17|31|and do not kill your children for fear of poverty we provide for them and for you indeed their killing is ever a great sin
17|32|and do not approach unlawful sexual intercourse indeed it is ever an immorality and is evil as a way
17|33|and do not kill the soul which allah has forbidden except by right and whoever is killed unjustly we have given his heir authority but let him not exceed limits in the matter of taking life indeed he has been supported by the law
17|34|and do not approach the property of an orphan except in the way that is best until he reaches maturity and fulfill every commitment indeed the commitment is ever that about which one will be questioned
17|35|and give full measure when you measure and weigh with an even balance that is the best way and best in result
17|36|and do not pursue that of which you have no knowledge indeed the hearing the sight and the heart about all those one will be questioned
17|37|and do not walk upon the earth exultantly indeed you will never tear the earth apart and you will never reach the mountains in height
17|38|all that its evil is ever in the sight of your lord detested
17|39|that is from what your lord has revealed to you o muhammad of wisdom and o mankind do not make as equal with allah another deity lest you be thrown into hell blamed and banished
17|40|then has your lord chosen you for having sons and taken from among the angels daughters indeed you say a grave saying
17|41|and we have certainly diversified the contents in this qur an that mankind may be reminded but it does not increase the disbelievers except in aversion
17|42|say o muhammad if there had been with him other gods as they say then they each would have sought to the owner of the throne a way
17|43|exalted is he and high above what they say by great sublimity
17|44|the seven heavens and the earth and whatever is in them exalt him and there is not a thing except that it exalts allah by his praise but you do not understand their way of exalting indeed he is ever forbearing and forgiving
17|45|and when you recite the qur an we put between you and those who do not believe in the hereafter a concealed partition
17|46|and we have placed over their hearts coverings lest they understand it and in their ears deafness and when you mention your lord alone in the qur an they turn back in aversion
17|47|we are most knowing of how they listen to it when they listen to you and of when they are in private conversation when the wrongdoers say you follow not but a man affected by magic
17|48|look how they strike for you comparisons but they have strayed so they cannot find a way
17|49|and they say when we are bones and crumbled particles will we truly be resurrected as a new creation
17|50|say be you stones or iron
17|51|or any creation of that which is great within your breasts and they will say who will restore us say he who brought you forth the first time then they will nod their heads toward you and say when is that say perhaps it will be soon
17|52|on the day he will call you and you will respond with praise of him and think that you had not remained in the world except for a little
17|53|and tell my servants to say that which is best indeed satan induces dissension among them indeed satan is ever to mankind a clear enemy
17|54|your lord is most knowing of you if he wills he will have mercy upon you or if he wills he will punish you and we have not sent you o muhammad over them as a manager
17|55|and your lord is most knowing of whoever is in the heavens and the earth and we have made some of the prophets exceed others in various ways and to david we gave the book of psalms
17|56|say invoke those you have claimed as gods besides him for they do not possess the ability for removal of adversity from you or for its transfer to someone else
17|57|those whom they invoke seek means of access to their lord striving as to which of them would be nearest and they hope for his mercy and fear his punishment indeed the punishment of your lord is ever feared
17|58|and there is no city but that we will destroy it before the day of resurrection or punish it with a severe punishment that has ever been in the register inscribed
17|59|and nothing has prevented us from sending signs except that the former peoples denied them and we gave thamud the she camel as a visible sign but they wronged her and we send not the signs except as a warning
17|60|and remember o muhammad when we told you indeed your lord has encompassed the people and we did not make the sight which we showed you except as a trial for the people as was the accursed tree mentioned in the qur an and we threaten them but it increases them not except in great transgression
17|61|and mention when we said to the angles prostrate to adam and they prostrated except for iblees he said should i prostrate to one you created from clay
17|62|iblees said do you see this one whom you have honored above me if you delay me until the day of resurrection i will surely destroy his descendants except for a few
17|63|allah said go for whoever of them follows you indeed hell will be the recompense of you an ample recompense
17|64|and incite to senselessness whoever you can among them with your voice and assault them with your horses and foot soldiers and become a partner in their wealth and their children and promise them but satan does not promise them except delusion
17|65|indeed over my believing servants there is for you no authority and sufficient is your lord as disposer of affairs
17|66|it is your lord who drives the ship for you through the sea that you may seek of his bounty indeed he is ever to you merciful
17|67|and when adversity touches you at sea lost are all those you invoke except for him but when he delivers you to the land you turn away from him and ever is man ungrateful
17|68|then do you feel secure that instead he will not cause a part of the land to swallow you or send against you a storm of stones then you would not find for yourselves an advocate
17|69|or do you feel secure that he will not send you back into the sea another time and send upon you a hurricane of wind and drown you for what you denied then you would not find for yourselves against us an avenger
17|70|and we have certainly honored the children of adam and carried them on the land and sea and provided for them of the good things and preferred them over much of what we have created with definite preference
17|71|mention o muhammad the day we will call forth every people with their record of deeds then whoever is given his record in his right hand those will read their records and injustice will not be done to them even as much as a thread inside the date seed
17|72|and whoever is blind in this life will be blind in the hereafter and more astray in way
17|73|and indeed they were about to tempt you away from that which we revealed to you in order to make you invent about us something else and then they would have taken you as a friend
17|74|and if we had not strengthened you you would have almost inclined to them a little
17|75|then if you had we would have made you taste double punishment in life and double after death then you would not find for yourself against us a helper
17|76|and indeed they were about to drive you from the land to evict you therefrom and then when they do they will not remain there after you except for a little
17|77|that is our established way for those we had sent before you of our messengers and you will not find in our way any alteration
17|78|establish prayer at the decline of the sun from its meridian until the darkness of the night and also the qur an of dawn indeed the recitation of dawn is ever witnessed
17|79|and from part of the night pray with it as additional worship for you it is expected that your lord will resurrect you to a praised station
17|80|and say my lord cause me to enter a sound entrance and to exit a sound exit and grant me from yourself a supporting authority
17|81|and say truth has come and falsehood has departed indeed is falsehood by nature ever bound to depart
17|82|and we send down of the qur an that which is healing and mercy for the believers but it does not increase the wrongdoers except in loss
17|83|and when we bestow favor upon the disbeliever he turns away and distances himself and when evil touches him he is ever despairing
17|84|say each works according to his manner but your lord is most knowing of who is best guided in way
17|85|and they ask you o muhammad about the soul say the soul is of the affair of my lord and mankind have not been given of knowledge except a little
17|86|and if we willed we could surely do away with that which we revealed to you then you would not find for yourself concerning it an advocate against us
17|87|except we have left it with you as a mercy from your lord indeed his favor upon you has ever been great
17|88|say if mankind and the jinn gathered in order to produce the like of this qur an they could not produce the like of it even if they were to each other assistants
17|89|and we have certainly diversified for the people in this qur an from every kind of example but most of the people refused anything except disbelief
17|90|and they say we will not believe you until you break open for us from the ground a spring
17|91|or until you have a garden of palm tress and grapes and make rivers gush forth within them in force and abundance
17|92|or you make the heaven fall upon us in fragments as you have claimed or you bring allah and the angels before us
17|93|or you have a house of gold or you ascend into the sky and even then we will not believe in your ascension until you bring down to us a book we may read say exalted is my lord was i ever but a human messenger
17|94|and what prevented the people from believing when guidance came to them except that they said has allah sent a human messenger
17|95|say if there were upon the earth angels walking securely we would have sent down to them from the heaven an angel as a messenger
17|96|say sufficient is allah as witness between me and you indeed he is ever concerning his servants acquainted and seeing
17|97|and whoever allah guides he is the rightly guided and whoever he sends astray you will never find for them protectors besides him and we will gather them on the day of resurrection fallen on their faces blind dumb and deaf their refuge is hell every time it subsides we increase them in blazing fire
17|98|that is their recompense because they disbelieved in our verses and said when we are bones and crumbled particles will we truly be resurrected in a new creation
17|99|do they not see that allah who created the heavens and earth is the one able to create the likes of them and he has appointed for them a term about which there is no doubt but the wrongdoers refuse anything except disbelief
17|100|say to them if you possessed the depositories of the mercy of my lord then you would withhold out of fear of spending and ever has man been stingy
17|101|and we had certainly given moses nine evident signs so ask the children of israel about when he came to them and pharaoh said to him indeed i think o moses that you are affected by magic
17|102|moses said you have already known that none has sent down these signs except the lord of the heavens and the earth as evidence and indeed i think o pharaoh that you are destroyed
17|103|so he intended to drive them from the land but we drowned him and those with him all together
17|104|and we said after pharaoh to the children of israel dwell in the land and when there comes the promise of the hereafter we will bring you forth in one gathering
17|105|and with the truth we have sent the qur an down and with the truth it has descended and we have not sent you o muhammad except as a bringer of good tidings and a warner
17|106|and it is a qur an which we have separated by intervals that you might recite it to the people over a prolonged period and we have sent it down progressively
17|107|say believe in it or do not believe indeed those who were given knowledge before it when it is recited to them they fall upon their faces in prostration
17|108|and they say exalted is our lord indeed the promise of our lord has been fulfilled
17|109|and they fall upon their faces weeping and the qur an increases them in humble submission
17|110|say call upon allah or call upon the most merciful whichever name you call to him belong the best names and do not recite too loudly in your prayer or too quietly but seek between that an intermediate way
17|111|and say praise to allah who has not taken a son and has had no partner in his dominion and has no need of a protector out of weakness and glorify him with great glorification
18|1|all praise is due to allah who has sent down upon his servant the book and has not made therein any deviance
18|2|he has made it straight to warn of severe punishment from him and to give good tidings to the believers who do righteous deeds that they will have a good reward
18|3|in which they will remain forever
18|4|and to warn those who say allah has taken a son
18|5|they have no knowledge of it nor had their fathers grave is the word that comes out of their mouths they speak not except a lie
18|6|then perhaps you would kill yourself through grief over them o muhammad if they do not believe in this message and out of sorrow
18|7|indeed we have made that which is on the earth adornment for it that we may test them as to which of them is best in deed
18|8|and indeed we will make that which is upon it into a barren ground
18|9|or have you thought that the companions of the cave and the inscription were among our signs a wonder
18|10|mention when the youths retreated to the cave and said our lord grant us from yourself mercy and prepare for us from our affair right guidance
18|11|so we cast a cover of sleep over their ears within the cave for a number of years
18|12|then we awakened them that we might show which of the two factions was most precise in calculating what extent they had remained in time
18|13|it is we who relate to you o muhammad their story in truth indeed they were youths who believed in their lord and we increased them in guidance
18|14|and we made firm their hearts when they stood up and said our lord is the lord of the heavens and the earth never will we invoke besides him any deity we would have certainly spoken then an excessive transgression
18|15|these our people have taken besides him deities why do they not bring for worship of them a clear authority and who is more unjust than one who invents about allah a lie
18|16|the youths said to one another and when you have withdrawn from them and that which they worship other than allah retreat to the cave your lord will spread out for you of his mercy and will prepare for you from your affair facility
18|17|and had you been present you would see the sun when it rose inclining away from their cave on the right and when it set passing away from them on the left while they were laying within an open space thereof that was from the signs of allah he whom allah guides is the rightly guided but he whom he leaves astray never will you find for him a protecting guide
18|18|and you would think them awake while they were asleep and we turned them to the right and to the left while their dog stretched his forelegs at the entrance if you had looked at them you would have turned from them in flight and been filled by them with terror
18|19|and similarly we awakened them that they might question one another said a speaker from among them how long have you remained here they said we have remained a day or part of a day they said your lord is most knowing of how long you remained so send one of you with this silver coin of yours to the city and let him look to which is the best of food and bring you provision from it and let him be cautious and let no one be aware of you
18|20|indeed if they come to know of you they will stone you or return you to their religion and never would you succeed then ever
18|21|and similarly we caused them to be found that they who found them would know that the promise of allah is truth and that of the hour there is no doubt that was when they disputed among themselves about their affair and then said construct over them a structure their lord is most knowing about them said those who prevailed in the matter we will surely take for ourselves over them a masjid
18|22|they will say there were three the fourth of them being their dog and they will say there were five the sixth of them being their dog guessing at the unseen and they will say there were seven and the eighth of them was their dog say o muhammad my lord is most knowing of their number none knows them except a few so do not argue about them except with an obvious argument and do not inquire about them among the speculators from anyone
18|23|and never say of anything indeed i will do that tomorrow
18|24|except when adding if allah wills and remember your lord when you forget it and say perhaps my lord will guide me to what is nearer than this to right conduct
18|25|and they remained in their cave for three hundred years and exceeded by nine
18|26|say allah is most knowing of how long they remained he has knowledge of the unseen aspects of the heavens and the earth how seeing is he and how hearing they have not besides him any protector and he shares not his legislation with anyone
18|27|and recite o muhammad what has been revealed to you of the book of your lord there is no changer of his words and never will you find in other than him a refuge
18|28|and keep yourself patient by being with those who call upon their lord in the morning and the evening seeking his countenance and let not your eyes pass beyond them desiring adornments of the worldly life and do not obey one whose heart we have made heedless of our remembrance and who follows his desire and whose affair is ever in neglect
18|29|and say the truth is from your lord so whoever wills let him believe and whoever wills let him disbelieve indeed we have prepared for the wrongdoers a fire whose walls will surround them and if they call for relief they will be relieved with water like murky oil which scalds their faces wretched is the drink and evil is the resting place
18|30|indeed those who have believed and done righteous deeds indeed we will not allow to be lost the reward of any who did well in deeds
18|31|those will have gardens of perpetual residence beneath them rivers will flow they will be adorned therein with bracelets of gold and will wear green garments of fine silk and brocade reclining therein on adorned couches excellent is the reward and good is the resting place
18|32|and present to them an example of two men we granted to one of them two gardens of grapevines and we bordered them with palm trees and placed between them fields of crops
18|33|each of the two gardens produced its fruit and did not fall short thereof in anything and we caused to gush forth within them a river
18|34|and he had fruit so he said to his companion while he was conversing with him i am greater than you in wealth and mightier in numbers of men
18|35|and he entered his garden while he was unjust to himself he said i do not think that this will perish ever
18|36|and i do not think the hour will occur and even if i should be brought back to my lord i will surely find better than this as a return
18|37|his companion said to him while he was conversing with him have you disbelieved in he who created you from dust and then from a sperm drop and then proportioned you as a man
18|38|but as for me he is allah my lord and i do not associate with my lord anyone
18|39|and why did you when you entered your garden not say what allah willed has occurred there is no power except in allah although you see me less than you in wealth and children
18|40|it may be that my lord will give me something better than your garden and will send upon it a calamity from the sky and it will become a smooth dusty ground
18|41|or its water will become sunken into the earth so you would never be able to seek it
18|42|and his fruits were encompassed by ruin so he began to turn his hands about in dismay over what he had spent on it while it had collapsed upon its trellises and said oh i wish i had not associated with my lord anyone
18|43|and there was for him no company to aid him other than allah nor could he defend himself
18|44|there the authority is completely for allah the truth he is best in reward and best in outcome
18|45|and present to them the example of the life of this world its being like rain which we send down from the sky and the vegetation of the earth mingles with it and then it becomes dry remnants scattered by the winds and allah is ever over all things perfect in ability
18|46|wealth and children are but adornment of the worldly life but the enduring good deeds are better to your lord for reward and better for one s hope
18|47|and warn of the day when we will remove the mountains and you will see the earth prominent and we will gather them and not leave behind from them anyone
18|48|and they will be presented before your lord in rows and he will say you have certainly come to us just as we created you the first time but you claimed that we would never make for you an appointment
18|49|and the record of deeds will be placed open and you will see the criminals fearful of that within it and they will say oh woe to us what is this book that leaves nothing small or great except that it has enumerated it and they will find what they did present before them and your lord does injustice to no one
18|50|and mention when we said to the angels prostrate to adam and they prostrated except for iblees he was of the jinn and departed from the command of his lord then will you take him and his descendants as allies other than me while they are enemies to you wretched it is for the wrongdoers as an exchange
18|51|i did not make them witness to the creation of the heavens and the earth or to the creation of themselves and i would not have taken the misguiders as assistants
18|52|and warn of the day when he will say call my partners whom you claimed and they will invoke them but they will not respond to them and we will put between them a valley of destruction
18|53|and the criminals will see the fire and will be certain that they are to fall therein and they will not find from it a way elsewhere
18|54|and we have certainly diversified in this qur an for the people from every kind of example but man has ever been most of anything prone to dispute
18|55|and nothing has prevented the people from believing when guidance came to them and from asking forgiveness of their lord except that there must befall them the accustomed precedent of the former peoples or that the punishment should come directly before them
18|56|and we send not the messengers except as bringers of good tidings and warners and those who disbelieve dispute by using falsehood to attempt to invalidate thereby the truth and have taken my verses and that of which they are warned in ridicule
18|57|and who is more unjust than one who is reminded of the verses of his lord but turns away from them and forgets what his hands have put forth indeed we have placed over their hearts coverings lest they understand it and in their ears deafness and if you invite them to guidance they will never be guided then ever
18|58|and your lord is the forgiving full of mercy if he were to impose blame upon them for what they earned he would have hastened for them the punishment rather for them is an appointment from which they will never find an escape
18|59|and those cities we destroyed them when they wronged and we made for their destruction an appointed time
18|60|and mention when moses said to his servant i will not cease traveling until i reach the junction of the two seas or continue for a long period
18|61|but when they reached the junction between them they forgot their fish and it took its course into the sea slipping away
18|62|so when they had passed beyond it moses said to his boy bring us our morning meal we have certainly suffered in this our journey much fatigue
18|63|he said did you see when we retired to the rock indeed i forgot there the fish and none made me forget it except satan that i should mention it and it took its course into the sea amazingly
18|64|moses said that is what we were seeking so they returned following their footprints
18|65|and they found a servant from among our servants to whom we had given mercy from us and had taught him from us a certain knowledge
18|66|moses said to him may i follow you on the condition that you teach me from what you have been taught of sound judgement
18|67|he said indeed with me you will never be able to have patience
18|68|and how can you have patience for what you do not encompass in knowledge
18|69|moses said you will find me if allah wills patient and i will not disobey you in any order
18|70|he said then if you follow me do not ask me about anything until i make to you about it mention
18|71|so they set out until when they had embarked on the ship al khidh r tore it open moses said have you torn it open to drown its people you have certainly done a grave thing
18|72|al khidh r said did i not say that with me you would never be able to have patience
18|73|moses said do not blame me for what i forgot and do not cover me in my matter with difficulty
18|74|so they set out until when they met a boy al khidh r killed him moses said have you killed a pure soul for other than having killed a soul you have certainly done a deplorable thing
18|75|al khidh r said did i not tell you that with me you would never be able to have patience
18|76|moses said if i should ask you about anything after this then do not keep me as a companion you have obtained from me an excuse
18|77|so they set out until when they came to the people of a town they asked its people for food but they refused to offer them hospitality and they found therein a wall about to collapse so al khidh r restored it moses said if you wished you could have taken for it a payment
18|78|al khidh r said this is parting between me and you i will inform you of the interpretation of that about which you could not have patience
18|79|as for the ship it belonged to poor people working at sea so i intended to cause defect in it as there was after them a king who seized every good ship by force
18|80|and as for the boy his parents were believers and we feared that he would overburden them by transgression and disbelief
18|81|so we intended that their lord should substitute for them one better than him in purity and nearer to mercy
18|82|and as for the wall it belonged to two orphan boys in the city and there was beneath it a treasure for them and their father had been righteous so your lord intended that they reach maturity and extract their treasure as a mercy from your lord and i did it not of my own accord that is the interpretation of that about which you could not have patience
18|83|and they ask you o muhammad about dhul qarnayn say i will recite to you about him a report
18|84|indeed we established him upon the earth and we gave him to everything a way
18|85|so he followed a way
18|86|until when he reached the setting of the sun he found it as if setting in a spring of dark mud and he found near it a people allah said o dhul qarnayn either you punish them or else adopt among them a way of goodness
18|87|he said as for one who wrongs we will punish him then he will be returned to his lord and he will punish him with a terrible punishment
18|88|but as for one who believes and does righteousness he will have a reward of paradise and we will speak to him from our command with ease
18|89|then he followed a way
18|90|until when he came to the rising of the sun he found it rising on a people for whom we had not made against it any shield
18|91|thus and we had encompassed all that he had in knowledge
18|92|then he followed a way
18|93|until when he reached a pass between two mountains he found beside them a people who could hardly understand his speech
18|94|they said o dhul qarnayn indeed gog and magog are great corrupters in the land so may we assign for you an expenditure that you might make between us and them a barrier
18|95|he said that in which my lord has established me is better than what you offer but assist me with strength i will make between you and them a dam
18|96|bring me sheets of iron until when he had leveled them between the two mountain walls he said blow with bellows until when he had made it like fire he said bring me that i may pour over it molten copper
18|97|so gog and magog were unable to pass over it nor were they able to effect in it any penetration
18|98|dhul qarnayn said this is a mercy from my lord but when the promise of my lord comes he will make it level and ever is the promise of my lord true
18|99|and we will leave them that day surging over each other and then the horn will be blown and we will assemble them in one assembly
18|100|and we will present hell that day to the disbelievers on display
18|101|those whose eyes had been within a cover removed from my remembrance and they were not able to hear
18|102|then do those who disbelieve think that they can take my servants instead of me as allies indeed we have prepared hell for the disbelievers as a lodging
18|103|say o muhammad shall we believers inform you of the greatest losers as to their deeds
18|104|they are those whose effort is lost in worldly life while they think that they are doing well in work
18|105|those are the ones who disbelieve in the verses of their lord and in their meeting him so their deeds have become worthless and we will not assign to them on the day of resurrection any importance
18|106|that is their recompense hell for what they denied and because they took my signs and my messengers in ridicule
18|107|indeed those who have believed and done righteous deeds they will have the gardens of paradise as a lodging
18|108|wherein they abide eternally they will not desire from it any transfer
18|109|say if the sea were ink for writing the words of my lord the sea would be exhausted before the words of my lord were exhausted even if we brought the like of it as a supplement
18|110|say i am only a man like you to whom has been revealed that your god is one god so whoever would hope for the meeting with his lord let him do righteous work and not associate in the worship of his lord anyone
19|1|kaf ha ya ayn sad
19|2|this is a mention of the mercy of your lord to his servant zechariah
19|3|when he called to his lord a private supplication
19|4|he said my lord indeed my bones have weakened and my head has filled with white and never have i been in my supplication to you my lord unhappy
19|5|and indeed i fear the successors after me and my wife has been barren so give me from yourself an heir
19|6|who will inherit me and inherit from the family of jacob and make him my lord pleasing to you
19|7|he was told o zechariah indeed we give you good tidings of a boy whose name will be john we have not assigned to any before this name
19|8|he said my lord how will i have a boy when my wife has been barren and i have reached extreme old age
19|9|an angel said thus it will be your lord says it is easy for me for i created you before while you were nothing
19|10|zechariah said my lord make for me a sign he said your sign is that you will not speak to the people for three nights being sound
19|11|so he came out to his people from the prayer chamber and signaled to them to exalt allah in the morning and afternoon
19|12|allah said o john take the scripture with determination and we gave him judgement while yet a boy
19|13|and affection from us and purity and he was fearing of allah
19|14|and dutiful to his parents and he was not a disobedient tyrant
19|15|and peace be upon him the day he was born and the day he dies and the day he is raised alive
19|16|and mention o muhammad in the book the story of mary when she withdrew from her family to a place toward the east
19|17|and she took in seclusion from them a screen then we sent to her our angel and he represented himself to her as a well proportioned man
19|18|she said indeed i seek refuge in the most merciful from you so leave me if you should be fearing of allah
19|19|he said i am only the messenger of your lord to give you news of a pure boy
19|20|she said how can i have a boy while no man has touched me and i have not been unchaste
19|21|he said thus it will be your lord says it is easy for me and we will make him a sign to the people and a mercy from us and it is a matter already decreed
19|22|so she conceived him and she withdrew with him to a remote place
19|23|and the pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a palm tree she said oh i wish i had died before this and was in oblivion forgotten
19|24|but he called her from below her do not grieve your lord has provided beneath you a stream
19|25|and shake toward you the trunk of the palm tree it will drop upon you ripe fresh dates
19|26|so eat and drink and be contented and if you see from among humanity anyone say indeed i have vowed to the most merciful abstention so i will not speak today to any man
19|27|then she brought him to her people carrying him they said o mary you have certainly done a thing unprecedented
19|28|o sister of aaron your father was not a man of evil nor was your mother unchaste
19|29|so she pointed to him they said how can we speak to one who is in the cradle a child
19|30|jesus said indeed i am the servant of allah he has given me the scripture and made me a prophet
19|31|and he has made me blessed wherever i am and has enjoined upon me prayer and zakah as long as i remain alive
19|32|and made me dutiful to my mother and he has not made me a wretched tyrant
19|33|and peace is on me the day i was born and the day i will die and the day i am raised alive
19|34|that is jesus the son of mary the word of truth about which they are in dispute
19|35|it is not befitting for allah to take a son exalted is he when he decrees an affair he only says to it be and it is
19|36|jesus said and indeed allah is my lord and your lord so worship him that is a straight path
19|37|then the factions differed concerning jesus from among them so woe to those who disbelieved from the scene of a tremendous day
19|38|how clearly they will hear and see the day they come to us but the wrongdoers today are in clear error
19|39|and warn them o muhammad of the day of regret when the matter will be concluded and yet they are in a state of heedlessness and they do not believe
19|40|indeed it is we who will inherit the earth and whoever is on it and to us they will be returned
19|41|and mention in the book the story of abraham indeed he was a man of truth and a prophet
19|42|mention when he said to his father o my father why do you worship that which does not hear and does not see and will not benefit you at all
19|43|o my father indeed there has come to me of knowledge that which has not come to you so follow me i will guide you to an even path
19|44|o my father do not worship satan indeed satan has ever been to the most merciful disobedient
19|45|o my father indeed i fear that there will touch you a punishment from the most merciful so you would be to satan a companion in hellfire
19|46|his father said have you no desire for my gods o abraham if you do not desist i will surely stone you so avoid me a prolonged time
19|47|abraham said peace will be upon you i will ask forgiveness for you of my lord indeed he is ever gracious to me
19|48|and i will leave you and those you invoke other than allah and will invoke my lord i expect that i will not be in invocation to my lord unhappy
19|49|so when he had left them and those they worshipped other than allah we gave him isaac and jacob and each of them we made a prophet
19|50|and we gave them of our mercy and we made for them a reputation of high honor
19|51|and mention in the book moses indeed he was chosen and he was a messenger and a prophet
19|52|and we called him from the side of the mount at his right and brought him near confiding to him
19|53|and we gave him out of our mercy his brother aaron as a prophet
19|54|and mention in the book ishmael indeed he was true to his promise and he was a messenger and a prophet
19|55|and he used to enjoin on his people prayer and zakah and was to his lord pleasing
19|56|and mention in the book idrees indeed he was a man of truth and a prophet
19|57|and we raised him to a high station
19|58|those were the ones upon whom allah bestowed favor from among the prophets of the descendants of adam and of those we carried in the ship with noah and of the descendants of abraham and israel and of those whom we guided and chose when the verses of the most merciful were recited to them they fell in prostration and weeping
19|59|but there came after them successors who neglected prayer and pursued desires so they are going to meet evil
19|60|except those who repent believe and do righteousness for those will enter paradise and will not be wronged at all
19|61|therein are gardens of perpetual residence which the most merciful has promised his servants in the unseen indeed his promise has ever been coming
19|62|they will not hear therein any ill speech only greetings of peace and they will have their provision therein morning and afternoon
19|63|that is paradise which we give as inheritance to those of our servants who were fearing of allah
19|64|gabriel said and we angels descend not except by the order of your lord to him belongs that before us and that behind us and what is in between and never is your lord forgetful
19|65|lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them so worship him and have patience for his worship do you know of any similarity to him
19|66|and the disbeliever says when i have died am i going to be brought forth alive
19|67|does man not remember that we created him before while he was nothing
19|68|so by your lord we will surely gather them and the devils then we will bring them to be present around hell upon their knees
19|69|then we will surely extract from every sect those of them who were worst against the most merciful in insolence
19|70|then surely it is we who are most knowing of those most worthy of burning therein
19|71|and there is none of you except he will come to it this is upon your lord an inevitability decreed
19|72|then we will save those who feared allah and leave the wrongdoers within it on their knees
19|73|and when our verses are recited to them as clear evidences those who disbelieve say to those who believe which of our two parties is best in position and best in association
19|74|and how many a generation have we destroyed before them who were better in possessions and outward appearance
19|75|say whoever is in error let the most merciful extend for him an extension in wealth and time until when they see that which they were promised either punishment in this world or the hour of resurrection they will come to know who is worst in position and weaker in soldiers
19|76|and allah increases those who were guided in guidance and the enduring good deeds are better to your lord for reward and better for recourse
19|77|then have you seen he who disbelieved in our verses and said i will surely be given wealth and children in the next life
19|78|has he looked into the unseen or has he taken from the most merciful a promise
19|79|no we will record what he says and extend for him from the punishment extensively
19|80|and we will inherit him in what he mentions and he will come to us alone
19|81|and they have taken besides allah false deities that they would be for them a source of honor
19|82|no those gods will deny their worship of them and will be against them opponents on the day of judgement
19|83|do you not see that we have sent the devils upon the disbelievers inciting them to evil with constant incitement
19|84|so be not impatient over them we only count out to them a limited number
19|85|on the day we will gather the righteous to the most merciful as a delegation
19|86|and will drive the criminals to hell in thirst
19|87|none will have power of intercession except he who had taken from the most merciful a covenant
19|88|and they say the most merciful has taken for himself a son
19|89|you have done an atrocious thing
19|90|the heavens almost rupture therefrom and the earth splits open and the mountains collapse in devastation
19|91|that they attribute to the most merciful a son
19|92|and it is not appropriate for the most merciful that he should take a son
19|93|there is no one in the heavens and earth but that he comes to the most merciful as a servant
19|94|he has enumerated them and counted them a full counting
19|95|and all of them are coming to him on the day of resurrection alone
19|96|indeed those who have believed and done righteous deeds the most merciful will appoint for them affection
19|97|so o muhammad we have only made qur an easy in the arabic language that you may give good tidings thereby to the righteous and warn thereby a hostile people
19|98|and how many have we destroyed before them of generations do you perceive of them anyone or hear from them a sound
20|1|ta ha
20|2|we have not sent down to you the qur an that you be distressed
20|3|but only as a reminder for those who fear allah
20|4|a revelation from he who created the earth and highest heavens
20|5|the most merciful who is above the throne established
20|6|to him belongs what is in the heavens and what is on the earth and what is between them and what is under the soil
20|7|and if you speak aloud then indeed he knows the secret and what is even more hidden
20|8|allah there is no deity except him to him belong the best names
20|9|and has the story of moses reached you
20|10|when he saw a fire and said to his family stay here indeed i have perceived a fire perhaps i can bring you a torch or find at the fire some guidance
20|11|and when he came to it he was called o moses
20|12|indeed i am your lord so remove your sandals indeed you are in the sacred valley of tuwa
20|13|and i have chosen you so listen to what is revealed to you
20|14|indeed i am allah there is no deity except me so worship me and establish prayer for my remembrance
20|15|indeed the hour is coming i almost conceal it so that every soul may be recompensed according to that for which it strives
20|16|so do not let one avert you from it who does not believe in it and follows his desire for you then would perish
20|17|and what is that in your right hand o moses
20|18|he said it is my staff i lean upon it and i bring down leaves for my sheep and i have therein other uses
20|19|allah said throw it down o moses
20|20|so he threw it down and thereupon it was a snake moving swiftly
20|21|allah said seize it and fear not we will return it to its former condition
20|22|and draw in your hand to your side it will come out white without disease another sign
20|23|that we may show you some of our greater signs
20|24|go to pharaoh indeed he has transgressed
20|25|moses said my lord expand for me my breast with assurance
20|26|and ease for me my task
20|27|and untie the knot from my tongue
20|28|that they may understand my speech
20|29|and appoint for me a minister from my family
20|30|aaron my brother
20|31|increase through him my strength
20|32|and let him share my task
20|33|that we may exalt you much
20|34|and remember you much
20|35|indeed you are of us ever seeing
20|36|allah said you have been granted your request o moses
20|37|and we had already conferred favor upon you another time
20|38|when we inspired to your mother what we inspired
20|39|saying cast him into the chest and cast it into the river and the river will throw it onto the bank there will take him an enemy to me and an enemy to him and i bestowed upon you love from me that you would be brought up under my eye
20|40|and we favored you when your sister went and said shall i direct you to someone who will be responsible for him so we restored you to your mother that she might be content and not grieve and you killed someone but we saved you from retaliation and tried you with a severe trial and you remained some years among the people of madyan then you came here at the decreed time o moses
20|41|and i produced you for myself
20|42|go you and your brother with my signs and do not slacken in my remembrance
20|43|go both of you to pharaoh indeed he has transgressed
20|44|and speak to him with gentle speech that perhaps he may be reminded or fear allah
20|45|they said our lord indeed we are afraid that he will hasten punishment against us or that he will transgress
20|46|allah said fear not indeed i am with you both i hear and i see
20|47|so go to him and say indeed we are messengers of your lord so send with us the children of israel and do not torment them we have come to you with a sign from your lord and peace will be upon he who follows the guidance
20|48|indeed it has been revealed to us that the punishment will be upon whoever denies and turns away
20|49|pharaoh said so who is the lord of you two o moses
20|50|he said our lord is he who gave each thing its form and then guided it
20|51|pharaoh said then what is the case of the former generations
20|52|moses said the knowledge thereof is with my lord in a record my lord neither errs nor forgets
20|53|it is he who has made for you the earth as a bed spread out and inserted therein for you roadways and sent down from the sky rain and produced thereby categories of various plants
20|54|eat therefrom and pasture your livestock indeed in that are signs for those of intelligence
20|55|from the earth we created you and into it we will return you and from it we will extract you another time
20|56|and we certainly showed pharaoh our signs all of them but he denied and refused
20|57|he said have you come to us to drive us out of our land with your magic o moses
20|58|then we will surely bring you magic like it so make between us and you an appointment which we will not fail to keep and neither will you in a place assigned
20|59|moses said your appointment is on the day of the festival when the people assemble at mid morning
20|60|so pharaoh went away put together his plan and then came to moses
20|61|moses said to the magicians summoned by pharaoh woe to you do not invent a lie against allah or he will exterminate you with a punishment and he has failed who invents such falsehood
20|62|so they disputed over their affair among themselves and concealed their private conversation
20|63|they said indeed these are two magicians who want to drive you out of your land with their magic and do away with your most exemplary way
20|64|so resolve upon your plan and then come forward in line and he has succeeded today who overcomes
20|65|they said o moses either you throw or we will be the first to throw
20|66|he said rather you throw and suddenly their ropes and staffs seemed to him from their magic that they were moving like snakes
20|67|and he sensed within himself apprehension did moses
20|68|allah said fear not indeed it is you who are superior
20|69|and throw what is in your right hand it will swallow up what they have crafted what they have crafted is but the trick of a magician and the magician will not succeed wherever he is
20|70|so the magicians fell down in prostration they said we have believed in the lord of aaron and moses
20|71|pharaoh said you believed him before i gave you permission indeed he is your leader who has taught you magic so i will surely cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides and i will crucify you on the trunks of palm trees and you will surely know which of us is more severe in giving punishment and more enduring
20|72|they said never will we prefer you over what has come to us of clear proofs and over he who created us so decree whatever you are to decree you can only decree for this worldly life
20|73|indeed we have believed in our lord that he may forgive us our sins and what you compelled us to do of magic and allah is better and more enduring
20|74|indeed whoever comes to his lord as a criminal indeed for him is hell he will neither die therein nor live
20|75|but whoever comes to him as a believer having done righteous deeds for those will be the highest degrees in position
20|76|gardens of perpetual residence beneath which rivers flow wherein they abide eternally and that is the reward of one who purifies himself
20|77|and we had inspired to moses travel by night with my servants and strike for them a dry path through the sea you will not fear being overtaken by pharaoh nor be afraid of drowning
20|78|so pharaoh pursued them with his soldiers and there covered them from the sea that which covered them
20|79|and pharaoh led his people astray and did not guide them
20|80|o children of israel we delivered you from your enemy and we made an appointment with you at the right side of the mount and we sent down to you manna and quails
20|81|saying eat from the good things with which we have provided you and do not transgress or oppress others therein lest my anger should descend upon you and he upon whom my anger descends has certainly fallen
20|82|but indeed i am the perpetual forgiver of whoever repents and believes and does righteousness and then continues in guidance
20|83|allah said and what made you hasten from your people o moses
20|84|he said they are close upon my tracks and i hastened to you my lord that you be pleased
20|85|allah said but indeed we have tried your people after you departed and the samiri has led them astray
20|86|so moses returned to his people angry and grieved he said o my people did your lord not make you a good promise then was the time of its fulfillment too long for you or did you wish that wrath from your lord descend upon you so you broke your promise of obedience to me
20|87|they said we did not break our promise to you by our will but we were made to carry burdens from the ornaments of the people of pharaoh so we threw them into the fire and thus did the samiri throw
20|88|and he extracted for them the statue of a calf which had a lowing sound and they said this is your god and the god of moses but he forgot
20|89|did they not see that it could not return to them any speech and that it did not possess for them any harm or benefit
20|90|and aaron had already told them before the return of moses o my people you are only being tested by it and indeed your lord is the most merciful so follow me and obey my order
20|91|they said we will never cease being devoted to the calf until moses returns to us
20|92|moses said o aaron what prevented you when you saw them going astray
20|93|from following me then have you disobeyed my order
20|94|aaron said o son of my mother do not seize me by my beard or by my head indeed i feared that you would say you caused division among the children of israel and you did not observe or await my word
20|95|moses said and what is your case o samiri
20|96|he said i saw what they did not see so i took a handful of dust from the track of the messenger and threw it and thus did my soul entice me
20|97|moses said then go and indeed it is decreed for you in this life to say no contact and indeed you have an appointment in the hereafter you will not fail to keep and look at your god to which you remained devoted we will surely burn it and blow it into the sea with a blast
20|98|your god is only allah except for whom there is no deity he has encompassed all things in knowledge
20|99|thus o muhammad we relate to you from the news of what has preceded and we have certainly given you from us the qur an
20|100|whoever turns away from it then indeed he will bear on the day of resurrection a burden
20|101|abiding eternally therein and evil it is for them on the day of resurrection as a load
20|102|the day the horn will be blown and we will gather the criminals that day blue eyed
20|103|they will murmur among themselves you remained not but ten days in the world
20|104|we are most knowing of what they say when the best of them in manner will say you remained not but one day
20|105|and they ask you about the mountains so say my lord will blow them away with a blast
20|106|and he will leave the earth a level plain
20|107|you will not see therein a depression or an elevation
20|108|that day everyone will follow the call of the caller with no deviation therefrom and all voices will be stilled before the most merciful so you will not hear except a whisper of footsteps
20|109|that day no intercession will benefit except that of one to whom the most merciful has given permission and has accepted his word
20|110|allah knows what is presently before them and what will be after them but they do not encompass it in knowledge
20|111|and all faces will be humbled before the ever living the sustainer of existence and he will have failed who carries injustice
20|112|but he who does of righteous deeds while he is a believer he will neither fear injustice nor deprivation
20|113|and thus we have sent it down as an arabic qur an and have diversified therein the warnings that perhaps they will avoid sin or it would cause them remembrance
20|114|so high above all is allah the sovereign the truth and o muhammad do not hasten with recitation of the qur an before its revelation is completed to you and say my lord increase me in knowledge
20|115|and we had already taken a promise from adam before but he forgot and we found not in him determination
20|116|and mention when we said to the angels prostrate to adam and they prostrated except iblees he refused
20|117|so we said o adam indeed this is an enemy to you and to your wife then let him not remove you from paradise so you would suffer
20|118|indeed it is promised for you not to be hungry therein or be unclothed
20|119|and indeed you will not be thirsty therein or be hot from the sun
20|120|then satan whispered to him he said o adam shall i direct you to the tree of eternity and possession that will not deteriorate
20|121|and adam and his wife ate of it and their private parts became apparent to them and they began to fasten over themselves from the leaves of paradise and adam disobeyed his lord and erred
20|122|then his lord chose him and turned to him in forgiveness and guided him
20|123|allah said descend from paradise all your descendants being enemies to one another and if there should come to you guidance from me then whoever follows my guidance will neither go astray in the world nor suffer in the hereafter
20|124|and whoever turns away from my remembrance indeed he will have a depressed life and we will gather him on the day of resurrection blind
20|125|he will say my lord why have you raised me blind while i was once seeing
20|126|allah will say thus did our signs come to you and you forgot them and thus will you this day be forgotten
20|127|and thus do we recompense he who transgressed and did not believe in the signs of his lord and the punishment of the hereafter is more severe and more enduring
20|128|then has it not become clear to them how many generations we destroyed before them as they walk among their dwellings indeed in that are signs for those of intelligence
20|129|and if not for a word that preceded from your lord punishment would have been an obligation due immediately and if not for a specified term decreed
20|130|so be patient over what they say and exalt allah with praise of your lord before the rising of the sun and before its setting and during periods of the night exalt him and at the ends of the day that you may be satisfied
20|131|and do not extend your eyes toward that by which we have given enjoyment to some categories of them its being but the splendor of worldly life by which we test them and the provision of your lord is better and more enduring
20|132|and enjoin prayer upon your family and people and be steadfast therein we ask you not for provision we provide for you and the best outcome is for those of righteousness
20|133|and they say why does he not bring us a sign from his lord has there not come to them evidence of what was in the former scriptures
20|134|and if we had destroyed them with a punishment before him they would have said our lord why did you not send to us a messenger so we could have followed your verses before we were humiliated and disgraced
20|135|say each of us is waiting so wait for you will know who are the companions of the sound path and who is guided
21|1|the time of their account has approached for the people while they are in heedlessness turning away
21|2|no mention comes to them anew from their lord except that they listen to it while they are at play
21|3|with their hearts distracted and those who do wrong conceal their private conversation saying is this prophet except a human being like you so would you approach magic while you are aware of it
21|4|the prophet said my lord knows whatever is said throughout the heaven and earth and he is the hearing the knowing
21|5|but they say the revelation is but a mixture of false dreams rather he has invented it rather he is a poet so let him bring us a sign just as the previous messengers were sent with miracles
21|6|not a single city which we destroyed believed before them so will they believe
21|7|and we sent not before you o muhammad except men to whom we revealed the message so ask the people of the message if you do not know
21|8|and we did not make the prophets forms not eating food nor were they immortal on earth
21|9|then we fulfilled for them the promise and we saved them and whom we willed and destroyed the transgressors
21|10|we have certainly sent down to you a book in which is your mention then will you not reason
21|11|and how many a city which was unjust have we shattered and produced after it another people
21|12|and when its inhabitants perceived our punishment at once they fled from it
21|13|some angels said do not flee but return to where you were given luxury and to your homes perhaps you will be questioned
21|14|they said o woe to us indeed we were wrongdoers
21|15|and that declaration of theirs did not cease until we made them as a harvest mowed down extinguished like a fire
21|16|and we did not create the heaven and earth and that between them in play
21|17|had we intended to take a diversion we could have taken it from what is with us if indeed we were to do so
21|18|rather we dash the truth upon falsehood and it destroys it and thereupon it departs and for you is destruction from that which you describe
21|19|to him belongs whoever is in the heavens and the earth and those near him are not prevented by arrogance from his worship nor do they tire
21|20|they exalt him night and day and do not slacken
21|21|or have men taken for themselves gods from the earth who resurrect the dead
21|22|had there been within the heavens and earth gods besides allah they both would have been ruined so exalted is allah lord of the throne above what they describe
21|23|he is not questioned about what he does but they will be questioned
21|24|or have they taken gods besides him say o muhammad produce your proof this qur an is the message for those with me and the message of those before me but most of them do not know the truth so they are turning away
21|25|and we sent not before you any messenger except that we revealed to him that there is no deity except me so worship me
21|26|and they say the most merciful has taken a son exalted is he rather they are but honored servants
21|27|they cannot precede him in word and they act by his command
21|28|he knows what is presently before them and what will be after them and they cannot intercede except on behalf of one whom he approves and they from fear of him are apprehensive
21|29|and whoever of them should say indeed i am a god besides him that one we would recompense with hell thus do we recompense the wrongdoers
21|30|have those who disbelieved not considered that the heavens and the earth were a joined entity and we separated them and made from water every living thing then will they not believe
21|31|and we placed within the earth firmly set mountains lest it should shift with them and we made therein mountain passes as roads that they might be guided
21|32|and we made the sky a protected ceiling but they from its signs are turning away
21|33|and it is he who created the night and the day and the sun and the moon all heavenly bodies in an orbit are swimming
21|34|and we did not grant to any man before you eternity on earth so if you die would they be eternal
21|35|every soul will taste death and we test you with evil and with good as trial and to us you will be returned
21|36|and when those who disbelieve see you o muhammad they take you not except in ridicule saying is this the one who insults your gods and they are at the mention of the most merciful disbelievers
21|37|man was created of haste i will show you my signs so do not impatiently urge me
21|38|and they say when is this promise if you should be truthful
21|39|if those who disbelieved but knew the time when they will not avert the fire from their faces or from their backs and they will not be aided
21|40|rather it will come to them unexpectedly and bewilder them and they will not be able to repel it nor will they be reprieved
21|41|and already were messengers ridiculed before you but those who mocked them were enveloped by what they used to ridicule
21|42|say who can protect you at night or by day from the most merciful but they are from the remembrance of their lord turning away
21|43|or do they have gods to defend them other than us they are unable even to help themselves nor can they be protected from us
21|44|but on the contrary we have provided good things for these disbelievers and their fathers until life was prolonged for them then do they not see that we set upon the land reducing it from its borders so it is they who will overcome
21|45|say i only warn you by revelation but the deaf do not hear the call when they are warned
21|46|and if as much as a whiff of the punishment of your lord should touch them they would surely say o woe to us indeed we have been wrongdoers
21|47|and we place the scales of justice for the day of resurrection so no soul will be treated unjustly at all and if there is even the weight of a mustard seed we will bring it forth and sufficient are we as accountant
21|48|and we had already given moses and aaron the criterion and a light and a reminder for the righteous
21|49|who fear their lord unseen while they are of the hour apprehensive
21|50|and this qur an is a blessed message which we have sent down then are you with it unacquainted
21|51|and we had certainly given abraham his sound judgement before and we were of him well knowing
21|52|when he said to his father and his people what are these statues to which you are devoted
21|53|they said we found our fathers worshippers of them
21|54|he said you were certainly you and your fathers in manifest error
21|55|they said have you come to us with truth or are you of those who jest
21|56|he said no rather your lord is the lord of the heavens and the earth who created them and i to that am of those who testify
21|57|and i swear by allah i will surely plan against your idols after you have turned and gone away
21|58|so he made them into fragments except a large one among them that they might return to it and question
21|59|they said who has done this to our gods indeed he is of the wrongdoers
21|60|they said we heard a young man mention them who is called abraham
21|61|they said then bring him before the eyes of the people that they may testify
21|62|they said have you done this to our gods o abraham
21|63|he said rather this the largest of them did it so ask them if they should be able to speak
21|64|so they returned to blaming themselves and said to each other indeed you are the wrongdoers
21|65|then they reversed themselves saying you have already known that these do not speak
21|66|he said then do you worship instead of allah that which does not benefit you at all or harm you
21|67|uff to you and to what you worship instead of allah then will you not use reason
21|68|they said burn him and support your gods if you are to act
21|69|allah said o fire be coolness and safety upon abraham
21|70|and they intended for him harm but we made them the greatest losers
21|71|and we delivered him and lot to the land which we had blessed for the worlds
21|72|and we gave him isaac and jacob in addition and all of them we made righteous
21|73|and we made them leaders guiding by our command and we inspired to them the doing of good deeds establishment of prayer and giving of zakah and they were worshippers of us
21|74|and to lot we gave judgement and knowledge and we saved him from the city that was committing wicked deeds indeed they were a people of evil defiantly disobedient
21|75|and we admitted him into our mercy indeed he was of the righteous
21|76|and mention noah when he called to allah before that time so we responded to him and saved him and his family from the great flood
21|77|and we saved him from the people who denied our signs indeed they were a people of evil so we drowned them all together
21|78|and mention david and solomon when they judged concerning the field when the sheep of a people overran it at night and we were witness to their judgement
21|79|and we gave understanding of the case to solomon and to each of them we gave judgement and knowledge and we subjected the mountains to exalt us along with david and also the birds and we were doing that
21|80|and we taught him the fashioning of coats of armor to protect you from your enemy in battle so will you then be grateful
21|81|and to solomon we subjected the wind blowing forcefully proceeding by his command toward the land which we had blessed and we are ever of all things knowing
21|82|and of the devils were those who dived for him and did work other than that and we were of them a guardian
21|83|and mention job when he called to his lord indeed adversity has touched me and you are the most merciful of the merciful
21|84|so we responded to him and removed what afflicted him of adversity and we gave him back his family and the like thereof with them as mercy from us and a reminder for the worshippers of allah
21|85|and mention ishmael and idrees and dhul kifl all were of the patient
21|86|and we admitted them into our mercy indeed they were of the righteous
21|87|and mention the man of the fish when he went off in anger and thought that we would not decree anything upon him and he called out within the darknesses there is no deity except you exalted are you indeed i have been of the wrongdoers
21|88|so we responded to him and saved him from the distress and thus do we save the believers
21|89|and mention zechariah when he called to his lord my lord do not leave me alone with no heir while you are the best of inheritors
21|90|so we responded to him and we gave to him john and amended for him his wife indeed they used to hasten to good deeds and supplicate us in hope and fear and they were to us humbly submissive
21|91|and mention the one who guarded her chastity so we blew into her garment through our angel gabriel and we made her and her son a sign for the worlds
21|92|indeed this your religion is one religion and i am your lord so worship me
21|93|and yet they divided their affair among themselves but all to us will return
21|94|so whoever does righteous deeds while he is a believer no denial will there be for his effort and indeed we of it are recorders
21|95|and there is prohibition upon the people of a city which we have destroyed that they will ever return
21|96|until when the dam of gog and magog has been opened and they from every elevation descend
21|97|and when the true promise has approached then suddenly the eyes of those who disbelieved will be staring in horror while they say o woe to us we had been unmindful of this rather we were wrongdoers
21|98|indeed you disbelievers and what you worship other than allah are the firewood of hell you will be coming to enter it
21|99|had these false deities been actual gods they would not have come to it but all are eternal therein
21|100|for them therein is heavy sighing and they therein will not hear
21|101|indeed those for whom the best reward has preceded from us they are from it far removed
21|102|they will not hear its sound while they are in that which their souls desire abiding eternally
21|103|they will not be grieved by the greatest terror and the angels will meet them saying this is your day which you have been promised
21|104|the day when we will fold the heaven like the folding of a written sheet for the records as we began the first creation we will repeat it that is a promise binding upon us indeed we will do it
21|105|and we have already written in the book of psalms after the previous mention that the land of paradise is inherited by my righteous servants
21|106|indeed in this qur an is notification for a worshipping people
21|107|and we have not sent you o muhammad except as a mercy to the worlds
21|108|say it is only revealed to me that your god is but one god so will you be muslims in submission to him
21|109|but if they turn away then say i have announced to all of you equally and i know not whether near or far is that which you are promised
21|110|indeed he knows what is declared of speech and he knows what you conceal
21|111|and i know not perhaps it is a trial for you and enjoyment for a time
21|112|the prophet has said my lord judge between us in truth and our lord is the most merciful the one whose help is sought against that which you describe
22|1|o mankind fear your lord indeed the convulsion of the final hour is a terrible thing
22|2|on the day you see it every nursing mother will be distracted from that child she was nursing and every pregnant woman will abort her pregnancy and you will see the people appearing intoxicated while they are not intoxicated but the punishment of allah is severe
22|3|and of the people is he who disputes about allah without knowledge and follows every rebellious devil
22|4|it has been decreed for every devil that whoever turns to him he will misguide him and will lead him to the punishment of the blaze
22|5|o people if you should be in doubt about the resurrection then consider that indeed we created you from dust then from a sperm drop then from a clinging clot and then from a lump of flesh formed and unformed that we may show you and we settle in the wombs whom we will for a specified term then we bring you out as a child and then we develop you that you may reach your time of maturity and among you is he who is taken in early death and among you is he who is returned to the most decrepit old age so that he knows after once having knowledge nothing and you see the earth barren but when we send down upon it rain it quivers and swells and grows something of every beautiful kind
22|6|that is because allah is the truth and because he gives life to the dead and because he is over all things competent
22|7|and that they may know that the hour is coming no doubt about it and that allah will resurrect those in the graves
22|8|and of the people is he who disputes about allah without knowledge or guidance or an enlightening book from him
22|9|twisting his neck in arrogance to mislead people from the way of allah for him in the world is disgrace and we will make him taste on the day of resurrection the punishment of the burning fire while it is said
22|10|that is for what your hands have put forth and because allah is not ever unjust to his servants
22|11|and of the people is he who worships allah on an edge if he is touched by good he is reassured by it but if he is struck by trial he turns on his face to the other direction he has lost this world and the hereafter that is what is the manifest loss
22|12|he invokes instead of allah that which neither harms him nor benefits him that is what is the extreme error
22|13|he invokes one whose harm is closer than his benefit how wretched the protector and how wretched the associate
22|14|indeed allah will admit those who believe and do righteous deeds to gardens beneath which rivers flow indeed allah does what he intends
22|15|whoever should think that allah will not support prophet muhammad in this world and the hereafter let him extend a rope to the ceiling then cut off his breath and let him see will his effort remove that which enrages him
22|16|and thus have we sent the qur an down as verses of clear evidence and because allah guides whom he intends
22|17|indeed those who have believed and those who were jews and the sabeans and the christians and the magians and those who associated with allah allah will judge between them on the day of resurrection indeed allah is over all things witness
22|18|do you not see that to allah prostrates whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth and the sun the moon the stars the mountains the trees the moving creatures and many of the people but upon many the punishment has been justified and he whom allah humiliates for him there is no bestower of honor indeed allah does what he wills
22|19|these are two adversaries who have disputed over their lord but those who disbelieved will have cut out for them garments of fire poured upon their heads will be scalding water
22|20|by which is melted that within their bellies and their skins
22|21|and for striking them are maces of iron
22|22|every time they want to get out of hellfire from anguish they will be returned to it and it will be said taste the punishment of the burning fire
22|23|indeed allah will admit those who believe and do righteous deeds to gardens beneath which rivers flow they will be adorned therein with bracelets of gold and pearl and their garments therein will be silk
22|24|and they had been guided in worldly life to good speech and they were guided to the path of the praiseworthy
22|25|indeed those who have disbelieved and avert people from the way of allah and from al masjid al haram which we made for the people equal are the resident therein and one from outside and also whoever intends a deed therein of deviation in religion or wrongdoing we will make him taste of a painful punishment
22|26|and mention o muhammad when we designated for abraham the site of the house saying do not associate anything with me and purify my house for those who perform tawaf and those who stand in prayer and those who bow and prostrate
22|27|and proclaim to the people the hajj pilgrimage they will come to you on foot and on every lean camel they will come from every distant pass
22|28|that they may witness benefits for themselves and mention the name of allah on known days over what he has provided for them of sacrificial animals so eat of them and feed the miserable and poor
22|29|then let them end their untidiness and fulfill their vows and perform tawaf around the ancient house
22|30|that has been commanded and whoever honors the sacred ordinances of allah it is best for him in the sight of his lord and permitted to you are the grazing livestock except what is recited to you so avoid the uncleanliness of idols and avoid false statement
22|31|inclining only to allah not associating anything with him and he who associates with allah it is as though he had fallen from the sky and was snatched by the birds or the wind carried him down into a remote place
22|32|that is so and whoever honors the symbols of allah indeed it is from the piety of hearts
22|33|for you the animals marked for sacrifice are benefits for a specified term then their place of sacrifice is at the ancient house
22|34|and for all religion we have appointed a rite of sacrifice that they may mention the name of allah over what he has provided for them of sacrificial animals for your god is one god so to him submit and o muhammad give good tidings to the humble before their lord
22|35|who when allah is mentioned their hearts are fearful and to the patient over what has afflicted them and the establishers of prayer and those who spend from what we have provided them
22|36|and the camels and cattle we have appointed for you as among the symbols of allah for you therein is good so mention the name of allah upon them when lined up for sacrifice and when they are lifeless on their sides then eat from them and feed the needy and the beggar thus have we subjected them to you that you may be grateful
22|37|their meat will not reach allah nor will their blood but what reaches him is piety from you thus have we subjected them to you that you may glorify allah for that to which he has guided you and give good tidings to the doers of good
22|38|indeed allah defends those who have believed indeed allah does not like everyone treacherous and ungrateful
22|39|permission to fight has been given to those who are being fought because they were wronged and indeed allah is competent to give them victory
22|40|they are those who have been evicted from their homes without right only because they say our lord is allah and were it not that allah checks the people some by means of others there would have been demolished monasteries churches synagogues and mosques in which the name of allah is much mentioned and allah will surely support those who support him indeed allah is powerful and exalted in might
22|41|and they are those who if we give them authority in the land establish prayer and give zakah and enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and to allah belongs the outcome of all matters
22|42|and if they deny you o muhammad so before them did the people of noah and aad and thamud deny their prophets
22|43|and the people of abraham and the people of lot
22|44|and the inhabitants of madyan and moses was denied so i prolonged enjoyment for the disbelievers then i seized them and how terrible was my reproach
22|45|and how many a city did we destroy while it was committing wrong so it is now fallen into ruin and how many an abandoned well and how many a lofty palace
22|46|so have they not traveled through the earth and have hearts by which to reason and ears by which to hear for indeed it is not eyes that are blinded but blinded are the hearts which are within the breasts
22|47|and they urge you to hasten the punishment but allah will never fail in his promise and indeed a day with your lord is like a thousand years of those which you count
22|48|and for how many a city did i prolong enjoyment while it was committing wrong then i seized it and to me is the final destination
22|49|say o people i am only to you a clear warner
22|50|and those who have believed and done righteous deeds for them is forgiveness and noble provision
22|51|but the ones who strove against our verses seeking to cause failure those are the companions of hellfire
22|52|and we did not send before you any messenger or prophet except that when he spoke or recited satan threw into it some misunderstanding but allah abolishes that which satan throws in then allah makes precise his verses and allah is knowing and wise
22|53|that is so he may make what satan throws in a trial for those within whose hearts is disease and those hard of heart and indeed the wrongdoers are in extreme dissension
22|54|and so those who were given knowledge may know that it is the truth from your lord and therefore believe in it and their hearts humbly submit to it and indeed is allah the guide of those who have believed to a straight path
22|55|but those who disbelieve will not cease to be in doubt of it until the hour comes upon them unexpectedly or there comes to them the punishment of a barren day
22|56|all sovereignty that day is for allah he will judge between them so they who believed and did righteous deeds will be in the gardens of pleasure
22|57|and they who disbelieved and denied our signs for those there will be a humiliating punishment
22|58|and those who emigrated for the cause of allah and then were killed or died allah will surely provide for them a good provision and indeed it is allah who is the best of providers
22|59|he will surely cause them to enter an entrance with which they will be pleased and indeed allah is knowing and forbearing
22|60|that is so and whoever responds to injustice with the equivalent of that with which he was harmed and then is tyrannized allah will surely aid him indeed allah is pardoning and forgiving
22|61|that is because allah causes the night to enter the day and causes the day to enter the night and because allah is hearing and seeing
22|62|that is because allah is the truth and that which they call upon other than him is falsehood and because allah is the most high the grand
22|63|do you not see that allah has sent down rain from the sky and the earth becomes green indeed allah is subtle and acquainted
22|64|to him belongs what is in the heavens and what is on the earth and indeed allah is the free of need the praiseworthy
22|65|do you not see that allah has subjected to you whatever is on the earth and the ships which run through the sea by his command and he restrains the sky from falling upon the earth unless by his permission indeed allah to the people is kind and merciful
22|66|and he is the one who gave you life then he causes you to die and then will again give you life indeed mankind is ungrateful
22|67|for every religion we have appointed rites which they perform so o muhammad let the disbelievers not contend with you over the matter but invite them to your lord indeed you are upon straight guidance
22|68|and if they dispute with you then say allah is most knowing of what you do
22|69|allah will judge between you on the day of resurrection concerning that over which you used to differ
22|70|do you not know that allah knows what is in the heaven and earth indeed that is in a record indeed that for allah is easy
22|71|and they worship besides allah that for which he has not sent down authority and that of which they have no knowledge and there will not be for the wrongdoers any helper
22|72|and when our verses are recited to them as clear evidences you recognize in the faces of those who disbelieve disapproval they are almost on the verge of assaulting those who recite to them our verses say then shall i inform you of what is worse than that it is the fire which allah has promised those who disbelieve and wretched is the destination
22|73|o people an example is presented so listen to it indeed those you invoke besides allah will never create as much as a fly even if they gathered together for that purpose and if the fly should steal away from them a tiny thing they could not recover it from him weak are the pursuer and pursued
22|74|they have not appraised allah with true appraisal indeed allah is powerful and exalted in might
22|75|allah chooses from the angels messengers and from the people indeed allah is hearing and seeing
22|76|he knows what is presently before them and what will be after them and to allah will be returned all matters
22|77|o you who have believed bow and prostrate and worship your lord and do good that you may succeed
22|78|and strive for allah with the striving due to him he has chosen you and has not placed upon you in the religion any difficulty it is the religion of your father abraham allah named you muslims before in former scriptures and in this revelation that the messenger may be a witness over you and you may be witnesses over the people so establish prayer and give zakah and hold fast to allah he is your protector and excellent is the protector and excellent is the helper
23|1|certainly will the believers have succeeded
23|2|they who are during their prayer humbly submissive
23|3|and they who turn away from ill speech
23|4|and they who are observant of zakah
23|5|and they who guard their private parts
23|6|except from their wives or those their right hands possess for indeed they will not be blamed
23|7|but whoever seeks beyond that then those are the transgressors
23|8|and they who are to their trusts and their promises attentive
23|9|and they who carefully maintain their prayers
23|10|those are the inheritors
23|11|who will inherit al firdaus they will abide therein eternally
23|12|and certainly did we create man from an extract of clay
23|13|then we placed him as a sperm drop in a firm lodging
23|14|then we made the sperm drop into a clinging clot and we made the clot into a lump of flesh and we made from the lump bones and we covered the bones with flesh then we developed him into another creation so blessed is allah the best of creators
23|15|then indeed after that you are to die
23|16|then indeed you on the day of resurrection will be resurrected
23|17|and we have created above you seven layered heavens and never have we been of our creation unaware
23|18|and we have sent down rain from the sky in a measured amount and settled it in the earth and indeed we are able to take it away
23|19|and we brought forth for you thereby gardens of palm trees and grapevines in which for you are abundant fruits and from which you eat
23|20|and we brought forth a tree issuing from mount sinai which produces oil and food for those who eat
23|21|and indeed for you in livestock is a lesson we give you drink from that which is in their bellies and for you in them are numerous benefits and from them you eat
23|22|and upon them and on ships you are carried
23|23|and we had certainly sent noah to his people and he said o my people worship allah you have no deity other than him then will you not fear him
23|24|but the eminent among those who disbelieved from his people said this is not but a man like yourselves who wishes to take precedence over you and if allah had willed to send a messenger he would have sent down angels we have not heard of this among our forefathers
23|25|he is not but a man possessed with madness so wait concerning him for a time
23|26|noah said my lord support me because they have denied me
23|27|so we inspired to him construct the ship under our observation and our inspiration and when our command comes and the oven overflows put into the ship from each creature two mates and your family except those for whom the decree of destruction has proceeded and do not address me concerning those who have wronged indeed they are to be drowned
23|28|and when you have boarded the ship you and those with you then say praise to allah who has saved us from the wrongdoing people
23|29|and say my lord let me land at a blessed landing place and you are the best to accommodate us
23|30|indeed in that are signs and indeed we are ever testing our servants
23|31|then we produced after them a generation of others
23|32|and we sent among them a messenger from themselves saying worship allah you have no deity other than him then will you not fear him
23|33|and the eminent among his people who disbelieved and denied the meeting of the hereafter while we had given them luxury in the worldly life said this is not but a man like yourselves he eats of that from which you eat and drinks of what you drink
23|34|and if you should obey a man like yourselves indeed you would then be losers
23|35|does he promise you that when you have died and become dust and bones that you will be brought forth once more
23|36|how far how far is that which you are promised
23|37|life is not but our worldly life we die and live but we will not be resurrected
23|38|he is not but a man who has invented a lie about allah and we will not believe him
23|39|he said my lord support me because they have denied me
23|40|allah said after a little they will surely become regretful
23|41|so the shriek seized them in truth and we made them as plant stubble then away with the wrongdoing people
23|42|then we produced after them other generations
23|43|no nation will precede its time of termination nor will they remain thereafter
23|44|then we sent our messengers in succession every time there came to a nation its messenger they denied him so we made them follow one another to destruction and we made them narrations so away with a people who do not believe
23|45|then we sent moses and his brother aaron with our signs and a clear authority
23|46|to pharaoh and his establishment but they were arrogant and were a haughty people
23|47|they said should we believe two men like ourselves while their people are for us in servitude
23|48|so they denied them and were of those destroyed
23|49|and we certainly gave moses the scripture that perhaps they would be guided
23|50|and we made the son of mary and his mother a sign and sheltered them within a high ground having level areas and flowing water
23|51|allah said o messengers eat from the good foods and work righteousness indeed i of what you do am knowing
23|52|and indeed this your religion is one religion and i am your lord so fear me
23|53|but the people divided their religion among them into sects each faction in what it has rejoicing
23|54|so leave them in their confusion for a time
23|55|do they think that what we extend to them of wealth and children
23|56|is because we hasten for them good things rather they do not perceive
23|57|indeed they who are apprehensive from fear of their lord
23|58|and they who believe in the signs of their lord
23|59|and they who do not associate anything with their lord
23|60|and they who give what they give while their hearts are fearful because they will be returning to their lord
23|61|it is those who hasten to good deeds and they outstrip others therein
23|62|and we charge no soul except with that within its capacity and with us is a record which speaks with truth and they will not be wronged
23|63|but their hearts are covered with confusion over this and they have evil deeds besides disbelief which they are doing
23|64|until when we seize their affluent ones with punishment at once they are crying to allah for help
23|65|do not cry out today indeed by us you will not be helped
23|66|my verses had already been recited to you but you were turning back on your heels
23|67|in arrogance regarding it conversing by night speaking evil
23|68|then have they not reflected over the qur an or has there come to them that which had not come to their forefathers
23|69|or did they not know their messenger so they are toward him disacknowledging
23|70|or do they say in him is madness rather he brought them the truth but most of them to the truth are averse
23|71|but if the truth had followed their inclinations the heavens and the earth and whoever is in them would have been ruined rather we have brought them their message but they from their message are turning away
23|72|or do you o muhammad ask them for payment but the reward of your lord is best and he is the best of providers
23|73|and indeed you invite them to a straight path
23|74|but indeed those who do not believe in the hereafter are deviating from the path
23|75|and even if we gave them mercy and removed what was upon them of affliction they would persist in their transgression wandering blindly
23|76|and we had gripped them with suffering as a warning but they did not yield to their lord nor did they humbly supplicate and will continue thus
23|77|until when we have opened before them a door of severe punishment immediately they will be therein in despair
23|78|and it is he who produced for you hearing and vision and hearts little are you grateful
23|79|and it is he who has multiplied you throughout the earth and to him you will be gathered
23|80|and it is he who gives life and causes death and his is the alternation of the night and the day then will you not reason
23|81|rather they say like what the former peoples said
23|82|they said when we have died and become dust and bones are we indeed to be resurrected
23|83|we have been promised this we and our forefathers before this is not but legends of the former peoples
23|84|say o muhammad to whom belongs the earth and whoever is in it if you should know
23|85|they will say to allah say then will you not remember
23|86|say who is lord of the seven heavens and lord of the great throne
23|87|they will say they belong to allah say then will you not fear him
23|88|say in whose hand is the realm of all things and he protects while none can protect against him if you should know
23|89|they will say all belongs to allah say then how are you deluded
23|90|rather we have brought them the truth and indeed they are liars
23|91|allah has not taken any son nor has there ever been with him any deity if there had been then each deity would have taken what it created and some of them would have sought to overcome others exalted is allah above what they describe concerning him
23|92|he is knower of the unseen and the witnessed so high is he above what they associate with him
23|93|say o muhammad my lord if you should show me that which they are promised
23|94|my lord then do not place me among the wrongdoing people
23|95|and indeed we are able to show you what we have promised them
23|96|repel by means of what is best their evil we are most knowing of what they describe
23|97|and say my lord i seek refuge in you from the incitements of the devils
23|98|and i seek refuge in you my lord lest they be present with me
23|99|for such is the state of the disbelievers until when death comes to one of them he says my lord send me back
23|100|that i might do righteousness in that which i left behind no it is only a word he is saying and behind them is a barrier until the day they are resurrected
23|101|so when the horn is blown no relationship will there be among them that day nor will they ask about one another
23|102|and those whose scales are heavy with good deeds it is they who are the successful
23|103|but those whose scales are light those are the ones who have lost their souls being in hell abiding eternally
23|104|the fire will sear their faces and they therein will have taut smiles
23|105|it will be said were not my verses recited to you and you used to deny them
23|106|they will say our lord our wretchedness overcame us and we were a people astray
23|107|our lord remove us from it and if we were to return to evil we would indeed be wrongdoers
23|108|he will say remain despised therein and do not speak to me
23|109|indeed there was a party of my servants who said our lord we have believed so forgive us and have mercy upon us and you are the best of the merciful
23|110|but you took them in mockery to the point that they made you forget my remembrance and you used to laugh at them
23|111|indeed i have rewarded them this day for their patient endurance that they are the attainers of success
23|112|allah will say how long did you remain on earth in number of years
23|113|they will say we remained a day or part of a day ask those who enumerate
23|114|he will say you stayed not but a little if only you had known
23|115|then did you think that we created you uselessly and that to us you would not be returned
23|116|so exalted is allah the sovereign the truth there is no deity except him lord of the noble throne
23|117|and whoever invokes besides allah another deity for which he has no proof then his account is only with his lord indeed the disbelievers will not succeed
23|118|and o muhammad say my lord forgive and have mercy and you are the best of the merciful
24|1|this is a surah which we have sent down and made that within it obligatory and revealed therein verses of clear evidence that you might remember
24|2|the unmarried woman or unmarried man found guilty of sexual intercourse lash each one of them with a hundred lashes and do not be taken by pity for them in the religion of allah if you should believe in allah and the last day and let a group of the believers witness their punishment
24|3|the fornicator does not marry except a female fornicator or polytheist and none marries her except a fornicator or a polytheist and that has been made unlawful to the believers
24|4|and those who accuse chaste women and then do not produce four witnesses lash them with eighty lashes and do not accept from them testimony ever after and those are the defiantly disobedient
24|5|except for those who repent thereafter and reform for indeed allah is forgiving and merciful
24|6|and those who accuse their wives of adultery and have no witnesses except themselves then the witness of one of them shall be four testimonies swearing by allah that indeed he is of the truthful
24|7|and the fifth oath will be that the curse of allah be upon him if he should be among the liars
24|8|but it will prevent punishment from her if she gives four testimonies swearing by allah that indeed he is of the liars
24|9|and the fifth oath will be that the wrath of allah be upon her if he was of the truthful
24|10|and if not for the favor of allah upon you and his mercy and because allah is accepting of repentance and wise
24|11|indeed those who came with falsehood are a group among you do not think it bad for you rather it is good for you for every person among them is what punishment he has earned from the sin and he who took upon himself the greater portion thereof for him is a great punishment
24|12|why when you heard it did not the believing men and believing women think good of one another and say this is an obvious falsehood
24|13|why did they who slandered not produce for it four witnesses and when they do not produce the witnesses then it is they in the sight of allah who are the liars
24|14|and if it had not been for the favor of allah upon you and his mercy in this world and the hereafter you would have been touched for that lie in which you were involved by a great punishment
24|15|when you received it with your tongues and said with your mouths that of which you had no knowledge and thought it was insignificant while it was in the sight of allah tremendous
24|16|and why when you heard it did you not say it is not for us to speak of this exalted are you o allah this is a great slander
24|17|allah warns you against returning to the likes of this conduct ever if you should be believers
24|18|and allah makes clear to you the verses and allah is knowing and wise
24|19|indeed those who like that immorality should be spread or publicized among those who have believed will have a painful punishment in this world and the hereafter and allah knows and you do not know
24|20|and if it had not been for the favor of allah upon you and his mercy and because allah is kind and merciful
24|21|o you who have believed do not follow the footsteps of satan and whoever follows the footsteps of satan indeed he enjoins immorality and wrongdoing and if not for the favor of allah upon you and his mercy not one of you would have been pure ever but allah purifies whom he wills and allah is hearing and knowing
24|22|and let not those of virtue among you and wealth swear not to give aid to their relatives and the needy and the emigrants for the cause of allah and let them pardon and overlook would you not like that allah should forgive you and allah is forgiving and merciful
24|23|indeed those who falsely accuse chaste unaware and believing women are cursed in this world and the hereafter and they will have a great punishment
24|24|on a day when their tongues their hands and their feet will bear witness against them as to what they used to do
24|25|that day allah will pay them in full their deserved recompense and they will know that it is allah who is the perfect in justice
24|26|evil words are for evil men and evil men are subjected to evil words and good words are for good men and good men are an object of good words those good people are declared innocent of what the slanderers say for them is forgiveness and noble provision
24|27|o you who have believed do not enter houses other than your own houses until you ascertain welcome and greet their inhabitants that is best for you perhaps you will be reminded
24|28|and if you do not find anyone therein do not enter them until permission has been given you and if it is said to you go back then go back it is purer for you and allah is knowing of what you do
24|29|there is no blame upon you for entering houses not inhabited in which there is convenience for you and allah knows what you reveal and what you conceal
24|30|tell the believing men to reduce some of their vision and guard their private parts that is purer for them indeed allah is acquainted with what they do
24|31|and tell the believing women to reduce some of their vision and guard their private parts and not expose their adornment except that which necessarily appears thereof and to wrap a portion of their headcovers over their chests and not expose their adornment except to their husbands their fathers their husbands fathers their sons their husbands sons their brothers their brothers sons their sisters sons their women that which their right hands possess or those male attendants having no physical desire or children who are not yet aware of the private aspects of women and let them not stamp their feet to make known what they conceal of their adornment and turn to allah in repentance all of you o believers that you might succeed
24|32|and marry the unmarried among you and the righteous among your male slaves and female slaves if they should be poor allah will enrich them from his bounty and allah is all encompassing and knowing
24|33|but let them who find not the means for marriage abstain from sexual relations until allah enriches them from his bounty and those who seek a contract for eventual emancipation from among whom your right hands possess then make a contract with them if you know there is within them goodness and give them from the wealth of allah which he has given you and do not compel your slave girls to prostitution if they desire chastity to seek thereby the temporary interests of worldly life and if someone should compel them then indeed allah is to them after their compulsion forgiving and merciful
24|34|and we have certainly sent down to you distinct verses and examples from those who passed on before you and an admonition for those who fear allah
24|35|allah is the light of the heavens and the earth the example of his light is like a niche within which is a lamp the lamp is within glass the glass as if it were a pearly white star lit from the oil of a blessed olive tree neither of the east nor of the west whose oil would almost glow even if untouched by fire light upon light allah guides to his light whom he wills and allah presents examples for the people and allah is knowing of all things
24|36|such niches are in mosques which allah has ordered to be raised and that his name be mentioned therein exalting him within them in the morning and the evenings
24|37|are men whom neither commerce nor sale distracts from the remembrance of allah and performance of prayer and giving of zakah they fear a day in which the hearts and eyes will fearfully turn about
24|38|that allah may reward them according to the best of what they did and increase them from his bounty and allah gives provision to whom he wills without account
24|39|but those who disbelieved their deeds are like a mirage in a lowland which a thirsty one thinks is water until when he comes to it he finds it is nothing but finds allah before him and he will pay him in full his due and allah is swift in account
24|40|or they are like darknesses within an unfathomable sea which is covered by waves upon which are waves over which are clouds darknesses some of them upon others when one puts out his hand therein he can hardly see it and he to whom allah has not granted light for him there is no light
24|41|do you not see that allah is exalted by whomever is within the heavens and the earth and by the birds with wings spread in flight each of them has known his means of prayer and exalting him and allah is knowing of what they do
24|42|and to allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and to allah is the destination
24|43|do you not see that allah drives clouds then he brings them together then he makes them into a mass and you see the rain emerge from within it and he sends down from the sky mountains of clouds within which is hail and he strikes with it whom he wills and averts it from whom he wills the flash of its lightening almost takes away the eyesight
24|44|allah alternates the night and the day indeed in that is a lesson for those who have vision
24|45|allah has created every living creature from water and of them are those that move on their bellies and of them are those that walk on two legs and of them are those that walk on four allah creates what he wills indeed allah is over all things competent
24|46|we have certainly sent down distinct verses and allah guides whom he wills to a straight path
24|47|but the hypocrites say we have believed in allah and in the messenger and we obey then a party of them turns away after that and those are not believers
24|48|and when they are called to the words of allah and his messenger to judge between them at once a party of them turns aside in refusal
24|49|but if the right is theirs they come to him in prompt obedience
24|50|is there disease in their hearts or have they doubted or do they fear that allah will be unjust to them or his messenger rather it is they who are the wrongdoers
24|51|the only statement of the true believers when they are called to allah and his messenger to judge between them is that they say we hear and we obey and those are the successful
24|52|and whoever obeys allah and his messenger and fears allah and is conscious of him it is those who are the attainers
24|53|and they swear by allah their strongest oaths that if you ordered them they would go forth in allah s cause say do not swear such obedience is known indeed allah is acquainted with that which you do
24|54|say obey allah and obey the messenger but if you turn away then upon him is only that duty with which he has been charged and upon you is that with which you have been charged and if you obey him you will be rightly guided and there is not upon the messenger except the responsibility for clear notification
24|55|allah has promised those who have believed among you and done righteous deeds that he will surely grant them succession to authority upon the earth just as he granted it to those before them and that he will surely establish for them therein their religion which he has preferred for them and that he will surely substitute for them after their fear security for they worship me not associating anything with me but whoever disbelieves after that then those are the defiantly disobedient
24|56|and establish prayer and give zakah and obey the messenger that you may receive mercy
24|57|never think that the disbelievers are causing failure to allah upon the earth their refuge will be the fire and how wretched the destination
24|58|o you who have believed let those whom your right hands possess and those who have not yet reached puberty among you ask permission of you before entering at three times before the dawn prayer and when you put aside your clothing for rest at noon and after the night prayer these are three times of privacy for you there is no blame upon you nor upon them beyond these periods for they continually circulate among you some of you among others thus does allah make clear to you the verses and allah is knowing and wise
24|59|and when the children among you reach puberty let them ask permission at all times as those before them have done thus does allah make clear to you his verses and allah is knowing and wise
24|60|and women of post menstrual age who have no desire for marriage there is no blame upon them for putting aside their outer garments but not displaying adornment but to modestly refrain from that is better for them and allah is hearing and knowing
24|61|there is not upon the blind any constraint nor upon the lame constraint nor upon the ill constraint nor upon yourselves when you eat from your own houses or the houses of your fathers or the houses of your mothers or the houses of your brothers or the houses of your sisters or the houses of your father s brothers or the houses of your father s sisters or the houses of your mother s brothers or the houses of your mother s sisters or from houses whose keys you possess or from the house of your friend there is no blame upon you whether you eat together or separately but when you enter houses give greetings of peace upon each other a greeting from allah blessed and good thus does allah make clear to you the verses of ordinance that you may understand
24|62|the believers are only those who believe in allah and his messenger and when they are meeting with him for a matter of common interest do not depart until they have asked his permission indeed those who ask your permission o muhammad those are the ones who believe in allah and his messenger so when they ask your permission for something of their affairs then give permission to whom you will among them and ask forgiveness for them of allah indeed allah is forgiving and merciful
24|63|do not make your calling of the messenger among yourselves as the call of one of you to another already allah knows those of you who slip away concealed by others so let those beware who dissent from the prophet s order lest fitnah strike them or a painful punishment
24|64|unquestionably to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and earth already he knows that upon which you stand and knows the day when they will be returned to him and he will inform them of what they have done and allah is knowing of all things
25|1|blessed is he who sent down the criterion upon his servant that he may be to the worlds a warner
25|2|he to whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and who has not taken a son and has not had a partner in dominion and has created each thing and determined it with precise determination
25|3|but they have taken besides him gods which create nothing while they are created and possess not for themselves any harm or benefit and possess not power to cause death or life or resurrection
25|4|and those who disbelieve say this qur an is not except a falsehood he invented and another people assisted him in it but they have committed an injustice and a lie
25|5|and they say legends of the former peoples which he has written down and they are dictated to him morning and afternoon
25|6|say o muhammad it has been revealed by he who knows every secret within the heavens and the earth indeed he is ever forgiving and merciful
25|7|and they say what is this messenger that eats food and walks in the markets why was there not sent down to him an angel so he would be with him a warner
25|8|or why is not a treasure presented to him from heaven or does he not have a garden from which he eats and the wrongdoers say you follow not but a man affected by magic
25|9|look how they strike for you comparisons but they have strayed so they cannot find a way
25|10|blessed is he who if he willed could have made for you something better than that gardens beneath which rivers flow and could make for you palaces
25|11|but they have denied the hour and we have prepared for those who deny the hour a blaze
25|12|when the hellfire sees them from a distant place they will hear its fury and roaring
25|13|and when they are thrown into a narrow place therein bound in chains they will cry out thereupon for destruction
25|14|they will be told do not cry this day for one destruction but cry for much destruction
25|15|say is that better or the garden of eternity which is promised to the righteous it will be for them a reward and destination
25|16|for them therein is whatever they wish while abiding eternally it is ever upon your lord a promise worthy to be requested
25|17|and mention the day he will gather them and that which they worship besides allah and will say did you mislead these my servants or did they themselves stray from the way
25|18|they will say exalted are you it was not for us to take besides you any allies but you provided comforts for them and their fathers until they forgot the message and became a people ruined
25|19|so they will deny you disbelievers in what you say and you cannot avert punishment or find help and whoever commits injustice among you we will make him taste a great punishment
25|20|and we did not send before you o muhammad any of the messengers except that they ate food and walked in the markets and we have made some of you people as trial for others will you have patience and ever is your lord seeing
25|21|and those who do not expect the meeting with us say why were not angels sent down to us or why do we not see our lord they have certainly become arrogant within themselves and become insolent with great insolence
25|22|the day they see the angels no good tidings will there be that day for the criminals and the angels will say prevented and inaccessible
25|23|and we will regard what they have done of deeds and make them as dust dispersed
25|24|the companions of paradise that day are in a better settlement and better resting place
25|25|and mention the day when the heaven will split open with emerging clouds and the angels will be sent down in successive descent
25|26|true sovereignty that day is for the most merciful and it will be upon the disbelievers a difficult day
25|27|and the day the wrongdoer will bite on his hands in regret he will say oh i wish i had taken with the messenger a way
25|28|oh woe to me i wish i had not taken that one as a friend
25|29|he led me away from the remembrance after it had come to me and ever is satan to man a deserter
25|30|and the messenger has said o my lord indeed my people have taken this qur an as a thing abandoned
25|31|and thus have we made for every prophet an enemy from among the criminals but sufficient is your lord as a guide and a helper
25|32|and those who disbelieve say why was the qur an not revealed to him all at once thus it is that we may strengthen thereby your heart and we have spaced it distinctly
25|33|and they do not come to you with an argument except that we bring you the truth and the best explanation
25|34|the ones who are gathered on their faces to hell those are the worst in position and farthest astray in their way
25|35|and we had certainly given moses the scripture and appointed with him his brother aaron as an assistant
25|36|and we said go both of you to the people who have denied our signs then we destroyed them with complete destruction
25|37|and the people of noah when they denied the messengers we drowned them and we made them for mankind a sign and we have prepared for the wrongdoers a painful punishment
25|38|and we destroyed aad and thamud and the companions of the well and many generations between them
25|39|and for each we presented examples as warnings and each we destroyed with total destruction
25|40|and they have already come upon the town which was showered with a rain of evil so have they not seen it but they are not expecting resurrection
25|41|and when they see you o muhammad they take you not except in ridicule saying is this the one whom allah has sent as a messenger
25|42|he almost would have misled us from our gods had we not been steadfast in worship of them but they are going to know when they see the punishment who is farthest astray in his way
25|43|have you seen the one who takes as his god his own desire then would you be responsible for him
25|44|or do you think that most of them hear or reason they are not except like livestock rather they are even more astray in their way
25|45|have you not considered your lord how he extends the shadow and if he willed he could have made it stationary then we made the sun for it an indication
25|46|then we hold it in hand for a brief grasp
25|47|and it is he who has made the night for you as clothing and sleep a means for rest and has made the day a resurrection
25|48|and it is he who sends the winds as good tidings before his mercy and we send down from the sky pure water
25|49|that we may bring to life thereby a dead land and give it as drink to those we created of numerous livestock and men
25|50|and we have certainly distributed it among them that they might be reminded but most of the people refuse except disbelief
25|51|and if we had willed we could have sent into every city a warner
25|52|so do not obey the disbelievers and strive against them with the qur an a great striving
25|53|and it is he who has released simultaneously the two seas one fresh and sweet and one salty and bitter and he placed between them a barrier and prohibiting partition
25|54|and it is he who has created from water a human being and made him a relative by lineage and marriage and ever is your lord competent concerning creation
25|55|but they worship rather than allah that which does not benefit them or harm them and the disbeliever is ever against his lord an assistant to satan
25|56|and we have not sent you o muhammad except as a bringer of good tidings and a warner
25|57|say i do not ask of you for it any payment only that whoever wills might take to his lord a way
25|58|and rely upon the ever living who does not die and exalt allah with his praise and sufficient is he to be with the sins of his servants acquainted
25|59|he who created the heavens and the earth and what is between them in six days and then established himself above the throne the most merciful so ask about him one well informed
25|60|and when it is said to them prostrate to the most merciful they say and what is the most merciful should we prostrate to that which you order us and it increases them in aversion
25|61|blessed is he who has placed in the sky great stars and placed therein a burning lamp and luminous moon
25|62|and it is he who has made the night and the day in succession for whoever desires to remember or desires gratitude
25|63|and the servants of the most merciful are those who walk upon the earth easily and when the ignorant address them harshly they say words of peace
25|64|and those who spend part of the night to their lord prostrating and standing in prayer
25|65|and those who say our lord avert from us the punishment of hell indeed its punishment is ever adhering
25|66|indeed it is evil as a settlement and residence
25|67|and they are those who when they spend do so not excessively or sparingly but are ever between that justly moderate
25|68|and those who do not invoke with allah another deity or kill the soul which allah has forbidden to be killed except by right and do not commit unlawful sexual intercourse and whoever should do that will meet a penalty
25|69|multiplied for him is the punishment on the day of resurrection and he will abide therein humiliated
25|70|except for those who repent believe and do righteous work for them allah will replace their evil deeds with good and ever is allah forgiving and merciful
25|71|and he who repents and does righteousness does indeed turn to allah with accepted repentance
25|72|and they are those who do not testify to falsehood and when they pass near ill speech they pass by with dignity
25|73|and those who when reminded of the verses of their lord do not fall upon them deaf and blind
25|74|and those who say our lord grant us from among our wives and offspring comfort to our eyes and make us an example for the righteous
25|75|those will be awarded the chamber for what they patiently endured and they will be received therein with greetings and words of peace
25|76|abiding eternally therein good is the settlement and residence
25|77|say what would my lord care for you if not for your supplication for you disbelievers have denied so your denial is going to be adherent
26|1|ta seen meem
26|2|these are the verses of the clear book
26|3|perhaps o muhammad you would kill yourself with grief that they will not be believers
26|4|if we willed we could send down to them from the sky a sign for which their necks would remain humbled
26|5|and no revelation comes to them anew from the most merciful except that they turn away from it
26|6|for they have already denied but there will come to them the news of that which they used to ridicule
26|7|did they not look at the earth how much we have produced therein from every noble kind
26|8|indeed in that is a sign but most of them were not to be believers
26|9|and indeed your lord he is the exalted in might the merciful
26|10|and mention when your lord called moses saying go to the wrongdoing people
26|11|the people of pharaoh will they not fear allah
26|12|he said my lord indeed i fear that they will deny me
26|13|and that my breast will tighten and my tongue will not be fluent so send for aaron
26|14|and they have upon me a claim due to sin so i fear that they will kill me
26|15|allah said no go both of you with our signs indeed we are with you listening
26|16|go to pharaoh and say we are the messengers of the lord of the worlds
26|17|commanded to say send with us the children of israel
26|18|pharaoh said did we not raise you among us as a child and you remained among us for years of your life
26|19|and then you did your deed which you did and you were of the ungrateful
26|20|moses said i did it then while i was of those astray
26|21|so i fled from you when i feared you then my lord granted me wisdom and prophethood and appointed me as one of the messengers
26|22|and is this a favor of which you remind me that you have enslaved the children of israel
26|23|said pharaoh and what is the lord of the worlds
26|24|moses said the lord of the heavens and earth and that between them if you should be convinced
26|25|pharaoh said to those around him do you not hear
26|26|moses said your lord and the lord of your first forefathers
26|27|pharaoh said indeed your messenger who has been sent to you is mad
26|28|moses said lord of the east and the west and that between them if you were to reason
26|29|pharaoh said if you take a god other than me i will surely place you among those imprisoned
26|30|moses said even if i brought you proof manifest
26|31|pharaoh said then bring it if you should be of the truthful
26|32|so moses threw his staff and suddenly it was a serpent manifest
26|33|and he drew out his hand thereupon it was white for the observers
26|34|pharaoh said to the eminent ones around him indeed this is a learned magician
26|35|he wants to drive you out of your land by his magic so what do you advise
26|36|they said postpone the matter of him and his brother and send among the cities gatherers
26|37|who will bring you every learned skilled magician
26|38|so the magicians were assembled for the appointment of a well known day
26|39|and it was said to the people will you congregate
26|40|that we might follow the magicians if they are the predominant
26|41|and when the magicians arrived they said to pharaoh is there indeed for us a reward if we are the predominant
26|42|he said yes and indeed you will then be of those near to me
26|43|moses said to them throw whatever you will throw
26|44|so they threw their ropes and their staffs and said by the might of pharaoh indeed it is we who are predominant
26|45|then moses threw his staff and at once it devoured what they falsified
26|46|so the magicians fell down in prostration to allah
26|47|they said we have believed in the lord of the worlds
26|48|the lord of moses and aaron
26|49|pharaoh said you believed moses before i gave you permission indeed he is your leader who has taught you magic but you are going to know i will surely cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides and i will surely crucify you all
26|50|they said no harm indeed to our lord we will return
26|51|indeed we aspire that our lord will forgive us our sins because we were the first of the believers
26|52|and we inspired to moses travel by night with my servants indeed you will be pursued
26|53|then pharaoh sent among the cities gatherers
26|54|and said indeed those are but a small band
26|55|and indeed they are enraging us
26|56|and indeed we are a cautious society
26|57|so we removed them from gardens and springs
26|58|and treasures and honorable station
26|59|thus and we caused to inherit it the children of israel
26|60|so they pursued them at sunrise
26|61|and when the two companies saw one another the companions of moses said indeed we are to be overtaken
26|62|moses said no indeed with me is my lord he will guide me
26|63|then we inspired to moses strike with your staff the sea and it parted and each portion was like a great towering mountain
26|64|and we advanced thereto the pursuers
26|65|and we saved moses and those with him all together
26|66|then we drowned the others
26|67|indeed in that is a sign but most of them were not to be believers
26|68|and indeed your lord he is the exalted in might the merciful
26|69|and recite to them the news of abraham
26|70|when he said to his father and his people what do you worship
26|71|they said we worship idols and remain to them devoted
26|72|he said do they hear you when you supplicate
26|73|or do they benefit you or do they harm
26|74|they said but we found our fathers doing thus
26|75|he said then do you see what you have been worshipping
26|76|you and your ancient forefathers
26|77|indeed they are enemies to me except the lord of the worlds
26|78|who created me and he it is who guides me
26|79|and it is he who feeds me and gives me drink
26|80|and when i am ill it is he who cures me
26|81|and who will cause me to die and then bring me to life
26|82|and who i aspire that he will forgive me my sin on the day of recompense
26|83|and he said my lord grant me authority and join me with the righteous
26|84|and grant me a reputation of honor among later generations
26|85|and place me among the inheritors of the garden of pleasure
26|86|and forgive my father indeed he has been of those astray
26|87|and do not disgrace me on the day they are all resurrected
26|88|the day when there will not benefit anyone wealth or children
26|89|but only one who comes to allah with a sound heart
26|90|and paradise will be brought near that day to the righteous
26|91|and hellfire will be brought forth for the deviators
26|92|and it will be said to them where are those you used to worship
26|93|other than allah can they help you or help themselves
26|94|so they will be overturned into hellfire they and the deviators
26|95|and the soldiers of iblees all together
26|96|they will say while they dispute therein
26|97|by allah we were indeed in manifest error
26|98|when we equated you with the lord of the worlds
26|99|and no one misguided us except the criminals
26|100|so now we have no intercessors
26|101|and not a devoted friend
26|102|then if we only had a return to the world and could be of the believers
26|103|indeed in that is a sign but most of them were not to be believers
26|104|and indeed your lord he is the exalted in might the merciful
26|105|the people of noah denied the messengers
26|106|when their brother noah said to them will you not fear allah
26|107|indeed i am to you a trustworthy messenger
26|108|so fear allah and obey me
26|109|and i do not ask you for it any payment my payment is only from the lord of the worlds
26|110|so fear allah and obey me
26|111|they said should we believe you while you are followed by the lowest class of people
26|112|he said and what is my knowledge of what they used to do
26|113|their account is only upon my lord if you could perceive
26|114|and i am not one to drive away the believers
26|115|i am only a clear warner
26|116|they said if you do not desist o noah you will surely be of those who are stoned
26|117|he said my lord indeed my people have denied me
26|118|then judge between me and them with decisive judgement and save me and those with me of the believers
26|119|so we saved him and those with him in the laden ship
26|120|then we drowned thereafter the remaining ones
26|121|indeed in that is a sign but most of them were not to be believers
26|122|and indeed your lord he is the exalted in might the merciful
26|123|aad denied the messengers
26|124|when their brother hud said to them will you not fear allah
26|125|indeed i am to you a trustworthy messenger
26|126|so fear allah and obey me
26|127|and i do not ask you for it any payment my payment is only from the lord of the worlds
26|128|do you construct on every elevation a sign amusing yourselves
26|129|and take for yourselves palaces and fortresses that you might abide eternally
26|130|and when you strike you strike as tyrants
26|131|so fear allah and obey me
26|132|and fear he who provided you with that which you know
26|133|provided you with grazing livestock and children
26|134|and gardens and springs
26|135|indeed i fear for you the punishment of a terrible day
26|136|they said it is all the same to us whether you advise or are not of the advisors
26|137|this is not but the custom of the former peoples
26|138|and we are not to be punished
26|139|and they denied him so we destroyed them indeed in that is a sign but most of them were not to be believers
26|140|and indeed your lord he is the exalted in might the merciful
26|141|thamud denied the messengers
26|142|when their brother salih said to them will you not fear allah
26|143|indeed i am to you a trustworthy messenger
26|144|so fear allah and obey me
26|145|and i do not ask you for it any payment my payment is only from the lord of the worlds
26|146|will you be left in what is here secure from death
26|147|within gardens and springs
26|148|and fields of crops and palm trees with softened fruit
26|149|and you carve out of the mountains homes with skill
26|150|so fear allah and obey me
26|151|and do not obey the order of the transgressors
26|152|who cause corruption in the land and do not amend
26|153|they said you are only of those affected by magic
26|154|you are but a man like ourselves so bring a sign if you should be of the truthful
26|155|he said this is a she camel for her is a time of drink and for you is a time of drink each on a known day
26|156|and do not touch her with harm lest you be seized by the punishment of a terrible day
26|157|but they hamstrung her and so became regretful
26|158|and the punishment seized them indeed in that is a sign but most of them were not to be believers
26|159|and indeed your lord he is the exalted in might the merciful
26|160|the people of lot denied the messengers
26|161|when their brother lot said to them will you not fear allah
26|162|indeed i am to you a trustworthy messenger
26|163|so fear allah and obey me
26|164|and i do not ask you for it any payment my payment is only from the lord of the worlds
26|165|do you approach males among the worlds
26|166|and leave what your lord has created for you as mates but you are a people transgressing
26|167|they said if you do not desist o lot you will surely be of those evicted
26|168|he said indeed i am toward your deed of those who detest it
26|169|my lord save me and my family from the consequence of what they do
26|170|so we saved him and his family all
26|171|except an old woman among those who remained behind
26|172|then we destroyed the others
26|173|and we rained upon them a rain of stones and evil was the rain of those who were warned
26|174|indeed in that is a sign but most of them were not to be believers
26|175|and indeed your lord he is the exalted in might the merciful
26|176|the companions of the thicket denied the messengers
26|177|when shu ayb said to them will you not fear allah
26|178|indeed i am to you a trustworthy messenger
26|179|so fear allah and obey me
26|180|and i do not ask you for it any payment my payment is only from the lord of the worlds
26|181|give full measure and do not be of those who cause loss
26|182|and weigh with an even balance
26|183|and do not deprive people of their due and do not commit abuse on earth spreading corruption
26|184|and fear he who created you and the former creation
26|185|they said you are only of those affected by magic
26|186|you are but a man like ourselves and indeed we think you are among the liars
26|187|so cause to fall upon us fragments of the sky if you should be of the truthful
26|188|he said my lord is most knowing of what you do
26|189|and they denied him so the punishment of the day of the black cloud seized them indeed it was the punishment of a terrible day
26|190|indeed in that is a sign but most of them were not to be believers
26|191|and indeed your lord he is the exalted in might the merciful
26|192|and indeed the qur an is the revelation of the lord of the worlds
26|193|the trustworthy spirit has brought it down
26|194|upon your heart o muhammad that you may be of the warners
26|195|in a clear arabic language
26|196|and indeed it is mentioned in the scriptures of former peoples
26|197|and has it not been a sign to them that it is recognized by the scholars of the children of israel
26|198|and even if we had revealed it to one among the foreigners
26|199|and he had recited it to them perfectly they would still not have been believers in it
26|200|thus have we inserted disbelief into the hearts of the criminals
26|201|they will not believe in it until they see the painful punishment
26|202|and it will come to them suddenly while they perceive it not
26|203|and they will say may we be reprieved
26|204|so for our punishment are they impatient
26|205|then have you considered if we gave them enjoyment for years
26|206|and then there came to them that which they were promised
26|207|they would not be availed by the enjoyment with which they were provided
26|208|and we did not destroy any city except that it had warners
26|209|as a reminder and never have we been unjust
26|210|and the devils have not brought the revelation down
26|211|it is not allowable for them nor would they be able
26|212|indeed they from its hearing are removed
26|213|so do not invoke with allah another deity and thus be among the punished
26|214|and warn o muhammad your closest kindred
26|215|and lower your wing to those who follow you of the believers
26|216|and if they disobey you then say indeed i am disassociated from what you are doing
26|217|and rely upon the exalted in might the merciful
26|218|who sees you when you arise
26|219|and your movement among those who prostrate
26|220|indeed he is the hearing the knowing
26|221|shall i inform you upon whom the devils descend
26|222|they descend upon every sinful liar
26|223|they pass on what is heard and most of them are liars
26|224|and the poets only the deviators follow them
26|225|do you not see that in every valley they roam
26|226|and that they say what they do not do
26|227|except those poets who believe and do righteous deeds and remember allah often and defend the muslims after they were wronged and those who have wronged are going to know to what kind of return they will be returned
27|1|ta seen these are the verses of the qur an and a clear book
27|2|as guidance and good tidings for the believers
27|3|who establish prayer and give zakah and of the hereafter they are certain in faith
27|4|indeed for those who do not believe in the hereafter we have made pleasing to them their deeds so they wander blindly
27|5|those are the ones for whom there will be the worst of punishment and in the hereafter they are the greatest losers
27|6|and indeed o muhammad you receive the qur an from one wise and knowing
27|7|mention when moses said to his family indeed i have perceived a fire i will bring you from there information or will bring you a burning torch that you may warm yourselves
27|8|but when he came to it he was called blessed is whoever is at the fire and whoever is around it and exalted is allah lord of the worlds
27|9|o moses indeed it is i allah the exalted in might the wise
27|10|and he was told throw down your staff but when he saw it writhing as if it were a snake he turned in flight and did not return allah said o moses fear not indeed in my presence the messengers do not fear
27|11|otherwise he who wrongs then substitutes good after evil indeed i am forgiving and merciful
27|12|and put your hand into the opening of your garment at the breast it will come out white without disease these are among the nine signs you will take to pharaoh and his people indeed they have been a people defiantly disobedient
27|13|but when there came to them our visible signs they said this is obvious magic
27|14|and they rejected them while their inner selves were convinced thereof out of injustice and haughtiness so see how was the end of the corrupters
27|15|and we had certainly given to david and solomon knowledge and they said praise is due to allah who has favored us over many of his believing servants
27|16|and solomon inherited david he said o people we have been taught the language of birds and we have been given from all things indeed this is evident bounty
27|17|and gathered for solomon were his soldiers of the jinn and men and birds and they were marching in rows
27|18|until when they came upon the valley of the ants an ant said o ants enter your dwellings that you not be crushed by solomon and his soldiers while they perceive not
27|19|so solomon smiled amused at her speech and said my lord enable me to be grateful for your favor which you have bestowed upon me and upon my parents and to do righteousness of which you approve and admit me by your mercy into the ranks of your righteous servants
27|20|and he took attendance of the birds and said why do i not see the hoopoe or is he among the absent
27|21|i will surely punish him with a severe punishment or slaughter him unless he brings me clear authorization
27|22|but the hoopoe stayed not long and said i have encompassed in knowledge that which you have not encompassed and i have come to you from sheba with certain news
27|23|indeed i found there a woman ruling them and she has been given of all things and she has a great throne
27|24|i found her and her people prostrating to the sun instead of allah and satan has made their deeds pleasing to them and averted them from his way so they are not guided
27|25|and so they do not prostrate to allah who brings forth what is hidden within the heavens and the earth and knows what you conceal and what you declare
27|26|allah there is no deity except him lord of the great throne
27|27|solomon said we will see whether you were truthful or were of the liars
27|28|take this letter of mine and deliver it to them then leave them and see what answer they will return
27|29|she said o eminent ones indeed to me has been delivered a noble letter
27|30|indeed it is from solomon and indeed it reads in the name of allah the entirely merciful the especially merciful
27|31|be not haughty with me but come to me in submission as muslims
27|32|she said o eminent ones advise me in my affair i would not decide a matter until you witness for me
27|33|they said we are men of strength and of great military might but the command is yours so see what you will command
27|34|she said indeed kings when they enter a city they ruin it and render the honored of its people humbled and thus do they do
27|35|but indeed i will send to them a gift and see with what reply the messengers will return
27|36|so when they came to solomon he said do you provide me with wealth but what allah has given me is better than what he has given you rather it is you who rejoice in your gift
27|37|return to them for we will surely come to them with soldiers that they will be powerless to encounter and we will surely expel them therefrom in humiliation and they will be debased
27|38|solomon said o assembly of jinn which of you will bring me her throne before they come to me in submission
27|39|a powerful one from among the jinn said i will bring it to you before you rise from your place and indeed i am for this task strong and trustworthy
27|40|said one who had knowledge from the scripture i will bring it to you before your glance returns to you and when solomon saw it placed before him he said this is from the favor of my lord to test me whether i will be grateful or ungrateful and whoever is grateful his gratitude is only for the benefit of himself and whoever is ungrateful then indeed my lord is free of need and generous
27|41|he said disguise for her her throne we will see whether she will be guided to truth or will be of those who is not guided
27|42|so when she arrived it was said to her is your throne like this she said it is as though it was it solomon said and we were given knowledge before her and we have been muslims in submission to allah
27|43|and that which she was worshipping other than allah had averted her from submission to him indeed she was from a disbelieving people
27|44|she was told enter the palace but when she saw it she thought it was a body of water and uncovered her shins to wade through he said indeed it is a palace whose floor is made smooth with glass she said my lord indeed i have wronged myself and i submit with solomon to allah lord of the worlds
27|45|and we had certainly sent to thamud their brother salih saying worship allah and at once they were two parties conflicting
27|46|he said o my people why are you impatient for evil instead of good why do you not seek forgiveness of allah that you may receive mercy
27|47|they said we consider you a bad omen you and those with you he said your omen is with allah rather you are a people being tested
27|48|and there were in the city nine family heads causing corruption in the land and not amending its affairs
27|49|they said take a mutual oath by allah that we will kill him by night he and his family then we will say to his executor we did not witness the destruction of his family and indeed we are truthful
27|50|and they planned a plan and we planned a plan while they perceived not
27|51|then look how was the outcome of their plan that we destroyed them and their people all
27|52|so those are their houses desolate because of the wrong they had done indeed in that is a sign for people who know
27|53|and we saved those who believed and used to fear allah
27|54|and mention lot when he said to his people do you commit immorality while you are seeing
27|55|do you indeed approach men with desire instead of women rather you are a people behaving ignorantly
27|56|but the answer of his people was not except that they said expel the family of lot from your city indeed they are people who keep themselves pure
27|57|so we saved him and his family except for his wife we destined her to be of those who remained behind
27|58|and we rained upon them a rain of stones and evil was the rain of those who were warned
27|59|say o muhammad praise be to allah and peace upon his servants whom he has chosen is allah better or what they associate with him
27|60|more precisely is he not best who created the heavens and the earth and sent down for you rain from the sky causing to grow thereby gardens of joyful beauty which you could not otherwise have grown the trees thereof is there a deity with allah no but they are a people who ascribe equals to him
27|61|is he not best who made the earth a stable ground and placed within it rivers and made for it firmly set mountains and placed between the two seas a barrier is there a deity with allah no but most of them do not know
27|62|is he not best who responds to the desperate one when he calls upon him and removes evil and makes you inheritors of the earth is there a deity with allah little do you remember
27|63|is he not best who guides you through the darknesses of the land and sea and who sends the winds as good tidings before his mercy is there a deity with allah high is allah above whatever they associate with him
27|64|is he not best who begins creation and then repeats it and who provides for you from the heaven and earth is there a deity with allah say produce your proof if you should be truthful
27|65|say none in the heavens and earth knows the unseen except allah and they do not perceive when they will be resurrected
27|66|rather their knowledge is arrested concerning the hereafter rather they are in doubt about it rather they are concerning it blind
27|67|and those who disbelieve say when we have become dust as well as our forefathers will we indeed be brought out of the graves
27|68|we have been promised this we and our forefathers before this is not but legends of the former peoples
27|69|say o muhammad travel through the land and observe how was the end of the criminals
27|70|and grieve not over them or be in distress from what they conspire
27|71|and they say when is the fulfillment of this promise if you should be truthful
27|72|say perhaps it is close behind you some of that for which you are impatient
27|73|and indeed your lord is full of bounty for the people but most of them do not show gratitude
27|74|and indeed your lord knows what their breasts conceal and what they declare
27|75|and there is nothing concealed within the heaven and the earth except that it is in a clear register
27|76|indeed this qur an relates to the children of israel most of that over which they disagree
27|77|and indeed it is guidance and mercy for the believers
27|78|indeed your lord will judge between them by his wise judgement and he is the exalted in might the knowing
27|79|so rely upon allah indeed you are upon the clear truth
27|80|indeed you will not make the dead hear nor will you make the deaf hear the call when they have turned their backs retreating
27|81|and you cannot guide the blind away from their error you will only make hear those who believe in our verses so they are muslims submitting to allah
27|82|and when the word befalls them we will bring forth for them a creature from the earth speaking to them saying that the people were of our verses not certain in faith
27|83|and warn of the day when we will gather from every nation a company of those who deny our signs and they will be driven in rows
27|84|until when they arrive at the place of judgement he will say did you deny my signs while you encompassed them not in knowledge or what was it that you were doing
27|85|and the decree will befall them for the wrong they did and they will not be able to speak
27|86|do they not see that we made the night that they may rest therein and the day giving sight indeed in that are signs for a people who believe
27|87|and warn of the day the horn will be blown and whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth will be terrified except whom allah wills and all will come to him humbled
27|88|and you see the mountains thinking them rigid while they will pass as the passing of clouds it is the work of allah who perfected all things indeed he is acquainted with that which you do
27|89|whoever comes at judgement with a good deed will have better than it and they from the terror of that day will be safe
27|90|and whoever comes with an evil deed their faces will be overturned into the fire and it will be said are you recompensed except for what you used to do
27|91|say o muhammad i have only been commanded to worship the lord of this city who made it sacred and to whom belongs all things and i am commanded to be of the muslims those who submit to allah
27|92|and to recite the qur an and whoever is guided is only guided for the benefit of himself and whoever strays say i am only one of the warners
27|93|and say all praise is due to allah he will show you his signs and you will recognize them and your lord is not unaware of what you do
28|1|ta seen meem
28|2|these are the verses of the clear book
28|3|we recite to you from the news of moses and pharaoh in truth for a people who believe
28|4|indeed pharaoh exalted himself in the land and made its people into factions oppressing a sector among them slaughtering their newborn sons and keeping their females alive indeed he was of the corrupters
28|5|and we wanted to confer favor upon those who were oppressed in the land and make them leaders and make them inheritors
28|6|and establish them in the land and show pharaoh and his minister haman and their soldiers through them that which they had feared
28|7|and we inspired to the mother of moses suckle him but when you fear for him cast him into the river and do not fear and do not grieve indeed we will return him to you and will make him one of the messengers
28|8|and the family of pharaoh picked him up out of the river so that he would become to them an enemy and a cause of grief indeed pharaoh and haman and their soldiers were deliberate sinners
28|9|and the wife of pharaoh said he will be a comfort of the eye for me and for you do not kill him perhaps he may benefit us or we may adopt him as a son and they perceived not
28|10|and the heart of moses mother became empty of all else she was about to disclose the matter concerning him had we not bound fast her heart that she would be of the believers
28|11|and she said to his sister follow him so she watched him from a distance while they perceived not
28|12|and we had prevented from him all wet nurses before so she said shall i direct you to a household that will be responsible for him for you while they are to him for his upbringing sincere
28|13|so we restored him to his mother that she might be content and not grieve and that she would know that the promise of allah is true but most of the people do not know
28|14|and when he attained his full strength and was mentally mature we bestowed upon him judgement and knowledge and thus do we reward the doers of good
28|15|and he entered the city at a time of inattention by its people and found therein two men fighting one from his faction and one from among his enemy and the one from his faction called for help to him against the one from his enemy so moses struck him and unintentionally killed him moses said this is from the work of satan indeed he is a manifest misleading enemy
28|16|he said my lord indeed i have wronged myself so forgive me and he forgave him indeed he is the forgiving the merciful
28|17|he said my lord for the favor you bestowed upon me i will never be an assistant to the criminals
28|18|and he became inside the city fearful and anticipating exposure when suddenly the one who sought his help the previous day cried out to him once again moses said to him indeed you are an evident persistent deviator
28|19|and when he wanted to strike the one who was an enemy to both of them he said o moses do you intend to kill me as you killed someone yesterday you only want to be a tyrant in the land and do not want to be of the amenders
28|20|and a man came from the farthest end of the city running he said o moses indeed the eminent ones are conferring over you intending to kill you so leave the city indeed i am to you of the sincere advisors
28|21|so he left it fearful and anticipating apprehension he said my lord save me from the wrongdoing people
28|22|and when he directed himself toward madyan he said perhaps my lord will guide me to the sound way
28|23|and when he came to the well of madyan he found there a crowd of people watering their flocks and he found aside from them two women driving back their flocks he said what is your circumstance they said we do not water until the shepherds dispatch their flocks and our father is an old man
28|24|so he watered their flocks for them then he went back to the shade and said my lord indeed i am for whatever good you would send down to me in need
28|25|then one of the two women came to him walking with shyness she said indeed my father invites you that he may reward you for having watered for us so when he came to him and related to him the story he said fear not you have escaped from the wrongdoing people
28|26|one of the women said o my father hire him indeed the best one you can hire is the strong and the trustworthy
28|27|he said indeed i wish to wed you one of these my two daughters on the condition that you serve me for eight years but if you complete ten it will be as a favor from you and i do not wish to put you in difficulty you will find me if allah wills from among the righteous
28|28|moses said that is established between me and you whichever of the two terms i complete there is no injustice to me and allah over what we say is witness
28|29|and when moses had completed the term and was traveling with his family he perceived from the direction of the mount a fire he said to his family stay here indeed i have perceived a fire perhaps i will bring you from there some information or burning wood from the fire that you may warm yourselves
28|30|but when he came to it he was called from the right side of the valley in a blessed spot from the tree o moses indeed i am allah lord of the worlds
28|31|and he was told throw down your staff but when he saw it writhing as if it was a snake he turned in flight and did not return allah said o moses approach and fear not indeed you are of the secure
28|32|insert your hand into the opening of your garment it will come out white without disease and draw in your arm close to you as prevention from fear for those are two proofs from your lord to pharaoh and his establishment indeed they have been a people defiantly disobedient
28|33|he said my lord indeed i killed from among them someone and i fear they will kill me
28|34|and my brother aaron is more fluent than me in tongue so send him with me as support verifying me indeed i fear that they will deny me
28|35|allah said we will strengthen your arm through your brother and grant you both supremacy so they will not reach you it will be through our signs you and those who follow you will be the predominant
28|36|but when moses came to them with our signs as clear evidences they said this is not except invented magic and we have not heard of this religion among our forefathers
28|37|and moses said my lord is more knowing than we or you of who has come with guidance from him and to whom will be succession in the home indeed wrongdoers do not succeed
28|38|and pharaoh said o eminent ones i have not known you to have a god other than me then ignite for me o haman a fire upon the clay and make for me a tower that i may look at the god of moses and indeed i do think he is among the liars
28|39|and he was arrogant he and his soldiers in the land without right and they thought that they would not be returned to us
28|40|so we took him and his soldiers and threw them into the sea so see how was the end of the wrongdoers
28|41|and we made them leaders inviting to the fire and on the day of resurrection they will not be helped
28|42|and we caused to overtake them in this world a curse and on the day of resurrection they will be of the despised
28|43|and we gave moses the scripture after we had destroyed the former generations as enlightenment for the people and guidance and mercy that they might be reminded
28|44|and you o muhammad were not on the western side of the mount when we revealed to moses the command and you were not among the witnesses to that
28|45|but we produced many generations after moses and prolonged was their duration and you were not a resident among the people of madyan reciting to them our verses but we were senders of this message
28|46|and you were not at the side of the mount when we called moses but were sent as a mercy from your lord to warn a people to whom no warner had come before you that they might be reminded
28|47|and if not that a disaster should strike them for what their hands put forth of sins and they would say our lord why did you not send us a messenger so we could have followed your verses and been among the believers
28|48|but when the truth came to them from us they said why was he not given like that which was given to moses did they not disbelieve in that which was given to moses before they said they are but two works of magic supporting each other and indeed we are in both disbelievers
28|49|say then bring a scripture from allah which is more guiding than either of them that i may follow it if you should be truthful
28|50|but if they do not respond to you then know that they only follow their own desires and who is more astray than one who follows his desire without guidance from allah indeed allah does not guide the wrongdoing people
28|51|and we have repeatedly conveyed to them the qur an that they might be reminded
28|52|those to whom we gave the scripture before it they are believers in it
28|53|and when it is recited to them they say we have believed in it indeed it is the truth from our lord indeed we were even before it muslims submitting to allah
28|54|those will be given their reward twice for what they patiently endured and because they avert evil through good and from what we have provided them they spend
28|55|and when they hear ill speech they turn away from it and say for us are our deeds and for you are your deeds peace will be upon you we seek not the ignorant
28|56|indeed o muhammad you do not guide whom you like but allah guides whom he wills and he is most knowing of the rightly guided
28|57|and they say if we were to follow the guidance with you we would be swept from our land have we not established for them a safe sanctuary to which are brought the fruits of all things as provision from us but most of them do not know
28|58|and how many a city have we destroyed that was insolent in its way of living and those are their dwellings which have not been inhabited after them except briefly and it is we who were the inheritors
28|59|and never would your lord have destroyed the cities until he had sent to their mother a messenger reciting to them our verses and we would not destroy the cities except while their people were wrongdoers
28|60|and whatever thing you people have been given it is only for the enjoyment of worldly life and its adornment and what is with allah is better and more lasting so will you not use reason
28|61|then is he whom we have promised a good promise which he will obtain like he for whom we provided enjoyment of worldly life but then he is on the day of resurrection among those presented for punishment in hell
28|62|and warn of the day he will call them and say where are my partners which you used to claim
28|63|those upon whom the word will have come into effect will say our lord these are the ones we led to error we led them to error just as we were in error we declare our disassociation from them to you they did not used to worship us
28|64|and it will be said invoke your partners and they will invoke them but they will not respond to them and they will see the punishment if only they had followed guidance
28|65|and mention the day he will call them and say what did you answer the messengers
28|66|but the information will be unapparent to them that day so they will not be able to ask one another
28|67|but as for one who had repented believed and done righteousness it is promised by allah that he will be among the successful
28|68|and your lord creates what he wills and chooses not for them was the choice exalted is allah and high above what they associate with him
28|69|and your lord knows what their breasts conceal and what they declare
28|70|and he is allah there is no deity except him to him is due all praise in the first life and the hereafter and his is the final decision and to him you will be returned
28|71|say have you considered if allah should make for you the night continuous until the day of resurrection what deity other than allah could bring you light then will you not hear
28|72|say have you considered if allah should make for you the day continuous until the day of resurrection what deity other than allah could bring you a night in which you may rest then will you not see
28|73|and out of his mercy he made for you the night and the day that you may rest therein and by day seek from his bounty and that perhaps you will be grateful
28|74|and warn of the day he will call them and say where are my partners which you used to claim
28|75|and we will extract from every nation a witness and say produce your proof and they will know that the truth belongs to allah and lost from them is that which they used to invent
28|76|indeed qarun was from the people of moses but he tyrannized them and we gave him of treasures whose keys would burden a band of strong men thereupon his people said to him do not exult indeed allah does not like the exultant
28|77|but seek through that which allah has given you the home of the hereafter and yet do not forget your share of the world and do good as allah has done good to you and desire not corruption in the land indeed allah does not like corrupters
28|78|he said i was only given it because of knowledge i have did he not know that allah had destroyed before him of generations those who were greater than him in power and greater in accumulation of wealth but the criminals about their sins will not be asked
28|79|so he came out before his people in his adornment those who desired the worldly life said oh would that we had like what was given to qarun indeed he is one of great fortune
28|80|but those who had been given knowledge said woe to you the reward of allah is better for he who believes and does righteousness and none are granted it except the patient
28|81|and we caused the earth to swallow him and his home and there was for him no company to aid him other than allah nor was he of those who could defend themselves
28|82|and those who had wished for his position the previous day began to say oh how allah extends provision to whom he wills of his servants and restricts it if not that allah had conferred favor on us he would have caused it to swallow us oh how the disbelievers do not succeed
28|83|that home of the hereafter we assign to those who do not desire exaltedness upon the earth or corruption and the best outcome is for the righteous
28|84|whoever comes on the day of judgement with a good deed will have better than it and whoever comes with an evil deed then those who did evil deeds will not be recompensed except as much as what they used to do
28|85|indeed o muhammad he who imposed upon you the qur an will take you back to a place of return say my lord is most knowing of who brings guidance and who is in clear error
28|86|and you were not expecting that the book would be conveyed to you but it is a mercy from your lord so do not be an assistant to the disbelievers
28|87|and never let them avert you from the verses of allah after they have been revealed to you and invite people to your lord and never be of those who associate others with allah
28|88|and do not invoke with allah another deity there is no deity except him everything will be destroyed except his face his is the judgement and to him you will be returned
29|1|alif lam meem
29|2|do the people think that they will be left to say we believe and they will not be tried
29|3|but we have certainly tried those before them and allah will surely make evident those who are truthful and he will surely make evident the liars
29|4|or do those who do evil deeds think they can outrun us evil is what they judge
29|5|whoever should hope for the meeting with allah indeed the term decreed by allah is coming and he is the hearing the knowing
29|6|and whoever strives only strives for the benefit of himself indeed allah is free from need of the worlds
29|7|and those who believe and do righteous deeds we will surely remove from them their misdeeds and will surely reward them according to the best of what they used to do
29|8|and we have enjoined upon man goodness to parents but if they endeavor to make you associate with me that of which you have no knowledge do not obey them to me is your return and i will inform you about what you used to do
29|9|and those who believe and do righteous deeds we will surely admit them among the righteous into paradise
29|10|and of the people are some who say we believe in allah but when one of them is harmed for the cause of allah they consider the trial of the people as if it were the punishment of allah but if victory comes from your lord they say indeed we were with you is not allah most knowing of what is within the breasts of all creatures
29|11|and allah will surely make evident those who believe and he will surely make evident the hypocrites
29|12|and those who disbelieve say to those who believe follow our way and we will carry your sins but they will not carry anything of their sins indeed they are liars
29|13|but they will surely carry their own burdens and other burdens along with their burdens and they will surely be questioned on the day of resurrection about what they used to invent
29|14|and we certainly sent noah to his people and he remained among them a thousand years minus fifty years and the flood seized them while they were wrongdoers
29|15|but we saved him and the companions of the ship and we made it a sign for the worlds
29|16|and we sent abraham when he said to his people worship allah and fear him that is best for you if you should know
29|17|you only worship besides allah idols and you produce a falsehood indeed those you worship besides allah do not possess for you the power of provision so seek from allah provision and worship him and be grateful to him to him you will be returned
29|18|and if you people deny the message already nations before you have denied and there is not upon the messenger except the duty of clear notification
29|19|have they not considered how allah begins creation and then repeats it indeed that for allah is easy
29|20|say o muhammad travel through the land and observe how he began creation then allah will produce the final creation indeed allah over all things is competent
29|21|he punishes whom he wills and has mercy upon whom he wills and to him you will be returned
29|22|and you will not cause failure to allah upon the earth or in the heaven and you have not other than allah any protector or any helper
29|23|and the ones who disbelieve in the signs of allah and the meeting with him those have despaired of my mercy and they will have a painful punishment
29|24|and the answer of abraham s people was not but that they said kill him or burn him but allah saved him from the fire indeed in that are signs for a people who believe
29|25|and abraham said you have only taken other than allah idols as a bond of affection among you in worldly life then on the day of resurrection you will deny one another and curse one another and your refuge will be the fire and you will not have any helpers
29|26|and lot believed him abraham said indeed i will emigrate to the service of my lord indeed he is the exalted in might the wise
29|27|and we gave to him isaac and jacob and placed in his descendants prophethood and scripture and we gave him his reward in this world and indeed he is in the hereafter among the righteous
29|28|and mention lot when he said to his people indeed you commit such immorality as no one has preceded you with from among the worlds
29|29|indeed you approach men and obstruct the road and commit in your meetings every evil and the answer of his people was not but they said bring us the punishment of allah if you should be of the truthful
29|30|he said my lord support me against the corrupting people
29|31|and when our messengers came to abraham with the good tidings they said indeed we will destroy the people of that lot s city indeed its people have been wrongdoers
29|32|abraham said indeed within it is lot they said we are more knowing of who is within it we will surely save him and his family except his wife she is to be of those who remain behind
29|33|and when our messengers came to lot he was distressed for them and felt for them great discomfort they said fear not nor grieve indeed we will save you and your family except your wife she is to be of those who remain behind
29|34|indeed we will bring down on the people of this city punishment from the sky because they have been defiantly disobedient
29|35|and we have certainly left of it a sign as clear evidence for a people who use reason
29|36|and to madyan we sent their brother shu ayb and he said o my people worship allah and expect the last day and do not commit abuse on the earth spreading corruption
29|37|but they denied him so the earthquake seized them and they became within their home corpses fallen prone
29|38|and we destroyed aad and thamud and it has become clear to you from their ruined dwellings and satan had made pleasing to them their deeds and averted them from the path and they were endowed with perception
29|39|and we destroyed qarun and pharaoh and haman and moses had already come to them with clear evidences and they were arrogant in the land but they were not outrunners of our punishment
29|40|so each we seized for his sin and among them were those upon whom we sent a storm of stones and among them were those who were seized by the blast from the sky and among them were those whom we caused the earth to swallow and among them were those whom we drowned and allah would not have wronged them but it was they who were wronging themselves
29|41|the example of those who take allies other than allah is like that of the spider who takes a home and indeed the weakest of homes is the home of the spider if they only knew
29|42|indeed allah knows whatever thing they call upon other than him and he is the exalted in might the wise
29|43|and these examples we present to the people but none will understand them except those of knowledge
29|44|allah created the heavens and the earth in truth indeed in that is a sign for the believers
29|45|recite o muhammad what has been revealed to you of the book and establish prayer indeed prayer prohibits immorality and wrongdoing and the remembrance of allah is greater and allah knows that which you do
29|46|and do not argue with the people of the scripture except in a way that is best except for those who commit injustice among them and say we believe in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to you and our god and your god is one and we are muslims in submission to him
29|47|and thus we have sent down to you the qur an and those to whom we previously gave the scripture believe in it and among these people of makkah are those who believe in it and none reject our verses except the disbelievers
29|48|and you did not recite before it any scripture nor did you inscribe one with your right hand otherwise the falsifiers would have had cause for doubt
29|49|rather the qur an is distinct verses preserved within the breasts of those who have been given knowledge and none reject our verses except the wrongdoers
29|50|but they say why are not signs sent down to him from his lord say the signs are only with allah and i am only a clear warner
29|51|and is it not sufficient for them that we revealed to you the book which is recited to them indeed in that is a mercy and reminder for a people who believe
29|52|say sufficient is allah between me and you as witness he knows what is in the heavens and earth and they who have believed in falsehood and disbelieved in allah it is those who are the losers
29|53|and they urge you to hasten the punishment and if not for the decree of a specified term punishment would have reached them but it will surely come to them suddenly while they perceive not
29|54|they urge you to hasten the punishment and indeed hell will be encompassing of the disbelievers
29|55|on the day the punishment will cover them from above them and from below their feet and it is said taste the result of what you used to do
29|56|o my servants who have believed indeed my earth is spacious so worship only me
29|57|every soul will taste death then to us will you be returned
29|58|and those who have believed and done righteous deeds we will surely assign to them of paradise elevated chambers beneath which rivers flow wherein they abide eternally excellent is the reward of the righteous workers
29|59|who have been patient and upon their lord rely
29|60|and how many a creature carries not its own provision allah provides for it and for you and he is the hearing the knowing
29|61|if you asked them who created the heavens and earth and subjected the sun and the moon they would surely say allah then how are they deluded
29|62|allah extends provision for whom he wills of his servants and restricts for him indeed allah is of all things knowing
29|63|and if you asked them who sends down rain from the sky and gives life thereby to the earth after its lifelessness they would surely say allah say praise to allah but most of them do not reason
29|64|and this worldly life is not but diversion and amusement and indeed the home of the hereafter that is the eternal life if only they knew
29|65|and when they board a ship they supplicate allah sincere to him in religion but when he delivers them to the land at once they associate others with him
29|66|so that they will deny what we have granted them and they will enjoy themselves but they are going to know
29|67|have they not seen that we made makkah a safe sanctuary while people are being taken away all around them then in falsehood do they believe and in the favor of allah they disbelieve
29|68|and who is more unjust than one who invents a lie about allah or denies the truth when it has come to him is there not in hell a sufficient residence for the disbelievers
29|69|and those who strive for us we will surely guide them to our ways and indeed allah is with the doers of good
30|1|alif lam meem
30|2|the byzantines have been defeated
30|3|in the nearest land but they after their defeat will overcome
30|4|within three to nine years to allah belongs the command before and after and that day the believers will rejoice
30|5|in the victory of allah he gives victory to whom he wills and he is the exalted in might the merciful
30|6|it is the promise of allah allah does not fail in his promise but most of the people do not know
30|7|they know what is apparent of the worldly life but they of the hereafter are unaware
30|8|do they not contemplate within themselves allah has not created the heavens and the earth and what is between them except in truth and for a specified term and indeed many of the people in the matter of the meeting with their lord are disbelievers
30|9|have they not traveled through the earth and observed how was the end of those before them they were greater than them in power and they plowed the earth and built it up more than they have built it up and their messengers came to them with clear evidences and allah would not ever have wronged them but they were wronging themselves
30|10|then the end of those who did evil was the worst consequence because they denied the signs of allah and used to ridicule them
30|11|allah begins creation then he will repeat it then to him you will be returned
30|12|and the day the hour appears the criminals will be in despair
30|13|and there will not be for them among their alleged partners any intercessors and they will then be disbelievers in their partners
30|14|and the day the hour appears that day they will become separated
30|15|and as for those who had believed and done righteous deeds they will be in a garden of paradise delighted
30|16|but as for those who disbelieved and denied our verses and the meeting of the hereafter those will be brought into the punishment to remain
30|17|so exalted is allah when you reach the evening and when you reach the morning
30|18|and to him is due all praise throughout the heavens and the earth and exalted is he at night and when you are at noon
30|19|he brings the living out of the dead and brings the dead out of the living and brings to life the earth after its lifelessness and thus will you be brought out
30|20|and of his signs is that he created you from dust then suddenly you were human beings dispersing throughout the earth
30|21|and of his signs is that he created for you from yourselves mates that you may find tranquillity in them and he placed between you affection and mercy indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought
30|22|and of his signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the diversity of your languages and your colors indeed in that are signs for those of knowledge
30|23|and of his signs is your sleep by night and day and your seeking of his bounty indeed in that are signs for a people who listen
30|24|and of his signs is that he shows you the lightning causing fear and aspiration and he sends down rain from the sky by which he brings to life the earth after its lifelessness indeed in that are signs for a people who use reason
30|25|and of his signs is that the heaven and earth remain by his command then when he calls you with a single call from the earth immediately you will come forth
30|26|and to him belongs whoever is in the heavens and earth all are to him devoutly obedient
30|27|and it is he who begins creation then he repeats it and that is even easier for him to him belongs the highest attribute in the heavens and earth and he is the exalted in might the wise
30|28|he presents to you an example from yourselves do you have among those whom your right hands possess any partners in what we have provided for you so that you are equal therein and would fear them as your fear of one another within a partnership thus do we detail the verses for a people who use reason
30|29|but those who wrong follow their own desires without knowledge then who can guide one whom allah has sent astray and for them there are no helpers
30|30|so direct your face toward the religion inclining to truth adhere to the fitrah of allah upon which he has created all people no change should there be in the creation of allah that is the correct religion but most of the people do not know
30|31|adhere to it turning in repentance to him and fear him and establish prayer and do not be of those who associate others with allah
30|32|or of those who have divided their religion and become sects every faction rejoicing in what it has
30|33|and when adversity touches the people they call upon their lord turning in repentance to him then when he lets them taste mercy from him at once a party of them associate others with their lord
30|34|so that they will deny what we have granted them then enjoy yourselves for you are going to know
30|35|or have we sent down to them an authority and it speaks of what they were associating with him
30|36|and when we let the people taste mercy they rejoice therein but if evil afflicts them for what their hands have put forth immediately they despair
30|37|do they not see that allah extends provision for whom he wills and restricts it indeed in that are signs for a people who believe
30|38|so give the relative his right as well as the needy and the traveler that is best for those who desire the countenance of allah and it is they who will be the successful
30|39|and whatever you give for interest to increase within the wealth of people will not increase with allah but what you give in zakah desiring the countenance of allah those are the multipliers
30|40|allah is the one who created you then provided for you then will cause you to die and then will give you life are there any of your partners who does anything of that exalted is he and high above what they associate with him
30|41|corruption has appeared throughout the land and sea by reason of what the hands of people have earned so he may let them taste part of the consequence of what they have done that perhaps they will return to righteousness
30|42|say o muhammad travel through the land and observe how was the end of those before most of them were associators of others with allah
30|43|so direct your face toward the correct religion before a day comes from allah of which there is no repelling that day they will be divided
30|44|whoever disbelieves upon him is the consequence of his disbelief and whoever does righteousness they are for themselves preparing
30|45|that he may reward those who have believed and done righteous deeds out of his bounty indeed he does not like the disbelievers
30|46|and of his signs is that he sends the winds as bringers of good tidings and to let you taste his mercy and so the ships may sail at his command and so you may seek of his bounty and perhaps you will be grateful
30|47|and we have already sent messengers before you to their peoples and they came to them with clear evidences then we took retribution from those who committed crimes and incumbent upon us was support of the believers
30|48|it is allah who sends the winds and they stir the clouds and spread them in the sky however he wills and he makes them fragments so you see the rain emerge from within them and when he causes it to fall upon whom he wills of his servants immediately they rejoice
30|49|although they were before it was sent down upon them before that in despair
30|50|so observe the effects of the mercy of allah how he gives life to the earth after its lifelessness indeed that same one will give life to the dead and he is over all things competent
30|51|but if we should send a bad wind and they saw their crops turned yellow they would remain thereafter disbelievers
30|52|so indeed you will not make the dead hear nor will you make the deaf hear the call when they turn their backs retreating
30|53|and you cannot guide the blind away from their error you will only make hear those who believe in our verses so they are muslims in submission to allah
30|54|allah is the one who created you from weakness then made after weakness strength then made after strength weakness and white hair he creates what he wills and he is the knowing the competent
30|55|and the day the hour appears the criminals will swear they had remained but an hour thus they were deluded
30|56|but those who were given knowledge and faith will say you remained the extent of allah s decree until the day of resurrection and this is the day of resurrection but you did not used to know
30|57|so that day their excuse will not benefit those who wronged nor will they be asked to appease allah
30|58|and we have certainly presented to the people in this qur an from every kind of example but o muhammad if you should bring them a sign the disbelievers will surely say you believers are but falsifiers
30|59|thus does allah seal the hearts of those who do not know
30|60|so be patient indeed the promise of allah is truth and let them not disquiet you who are not certain in faith
31|1|alif lam meem
31|2|these are verses of the wise book
31|3|as guidance and mercy for the doers of good
31|4|who establish prayer and give zakah and they of the hereafter are certain in faith
31|5|those are on right guidance from their lord and it is those who are the successful
31|6|and of the people is he who buys the amusement of speech to mislead others from the way of allah without knowledge and who takes it in ridicule those will have a humiliating punishment
31|7|and when our verses are recited to him he turns away arrogantly as if he had not heard them as if there was in his ears deafness so give him tidings of a painful punishment
31|8|indeed those who believe and do righteous deeds for them are the gardens of pleasure
31|9|wherein they abide eternally it is the promise of allah which is truth and he is the exalted in might the wise
31|10|he created the heavens without pillars that you see and has cast into the earth firmly set mountains lest it should shift with you and dispersed therein from every creature and we sent down rain from the sky and made grow therein plants of every noble kind
31|11|this is the creation of allah so show me what those other than him have created rather the wrongdoers are in clear error
31|12|and we had certainly given luqman wisdom and said be grateful to allah and whoever is grateful is grateful for the benefit of himself and whoever denies his favor then indeed allah is free of need and praiseworthy
31|13|and mention o muhammad when luqman said to his son while he was instructing him o my son do not associate anything with allah indeed association with him is great injustice
31|14|and we have enjoined upon man care for his parents his mother carried him increasing her in weakness upon weakness and his weaning is in two years be grateful to me and to your parents to me is the final destination
31|15|but if they endeavor to make you associate with me that of which you have no knowledge do not obey them but accompany them in this world with appropriate kindness and follow the way of those who turn back to me in repentance then to me will be your return and i will inform you about what you used to do
31|16|and luqman said o my son indeed if wrong should be the weight of a mustard seed and should be within a rock or anywhere in the heavens or in the earth allah will bring it forth indeed allah is subtle and acquainted
31|17|o my son establish prayer enjoin what is right forbid what is wrong and be patient over what befalls you indeed all that is of the matters requiring determination
31|18|and do not turn your cheek in contempt toward people and do not walk through the earth exultantly indeed allah does not like everyone self deluded and boastful
31|19|and be moderate in your pace and lower your voice indeed the most disagreeable of sounds is the voice of donkeys
31|20|do you not see that allah has made subject to you whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth and amply bestowed upon you his favors both apparent and unapparent but of the people is he who disputes about allah without knowledge or guidance or an enlightening book from him
31|21|and when it is said to them follow what allah has revealed they say rather we will follow that upon which we found our fathers even if satan was inviting them to the punishment of the blaze
31|22|and whoever submits his face to allah while he is a doer of good then he has grasped the most trustworthy handhold and to allah will be the outcome of all matters
31|23|and whoever has disbelieved let not his disbelief grieve you to us is their return and we will inform them of what they did indeed allah is knowing of that within the breasts
31|24|we grant them enjoyment for a little then we will force them to a massive punishment
31|25|and if you asked them who created the heavens and earth they would surely say allah say all praise is due to allah but most of them do not know
31|26|to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and earth indeed allah is the free of need the praiseworthy
31|27|and if whatever trees upon the earth were pens and the sea was ink replenished thereafter by seven more seas the words of allah would not be exhausted indeed allah is exalted in might and wise
31|28|your creation and your resurrection will not be but as that of a single soul indeed allah is hearing and seeing
31|29|do you not see that allah causes the night to enter the day and causes the day to enter the night and has subjected the sun and the moon each running its course for a specified term and that allah with whatever you do is acquainted
31|30|that is because allah is the truth and that what they call upon other than him is falsehood and because allah is the most high the grand
31|31|do you not see that ships sail through the sea by the favor of allah that he may show you of his signs indeed in that are signs for everyone patient and grateful
31|32|and when waves come over them like canopies they supplicate allah sincere to him in religion but when he delivers them to the land there are some of them who are moderate in faith and none rejects our signs except everyone treacherous and ungrateful
31|33|o mankind fear your lord and fear a day when no father will avail his son nor will a son avail his father at all indeed the promise of allah is truth so let not the worldly life delude you and be not deceived about allah by the deceiver
31|34|indeed allah alone has knowledge of the hour and sends down the rain and knows what is in the wombs and no soul perceives what it will earn tomorrow and no soul perceives in what land it will die indeed allah is knowing and acquainted
32|1|alif lam meem
32|2|this is the revelation of the book about which there is no doubt from the lord of the worlds
32|3|or do they say he invented it rather it is the truth from your lord o muhammad that you may warn a people to whom no warner has come before you so perhaps they will be guided
32|4|it is allah who created the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them in six days then he established himself above the throne you have not besides him any protector or any intercessor so will you not be reminded
32|5|he arranges each matter from the heaven to the earth then it will ascend to him in a day the extent of which is a thousand years of those which you count
32|6|that is the knower of the unseen and the witnessed the exalted in might the merciful
32|7|who perfected everything which he created and began the creation of man from clay
32|8|then he made his posterity out of the extract of a liquid disdained
32|9|then he proportioned him and breathed into him from his created soul and made for you hearing and vision and hearts little are you grateful
32|10|and they say when we are lost within the earth will we indeed be recreated in a new creation rather they are in the matter of the meeting with their lord disbelievers
32|11|say the angel of death will take you who has been entrusted with you then to your lord you will be returned
32|12|if you could but see when the criminals are hanging their heads before their lord saying our lord we have seen and heard so return us to the world we will work righteousness indeed we are now certain
32|13|and if we had willed we could have given every soul its guidance but the word from me will come into effect that i will surely fill hell with jinn and people all together
32|14|so taste punishment because you forgot the meeting of this your day indeed we have accordingly forgotten you and taste the punishment of eternity for what you used to do
32|15|only those believe in our verses who when they are reminded by them fall down in prostration and exalt allah with praise of their lord and they are not arrogant
32|16|they arise from their beds they supplicate their lord in fear and aspiration and from what we have provided them they spend
32|17|and no soul knows what has been hidden for them of comfort for eyes as reward for what they used to do
32|18|then is one who was a believer like one who was defiantly disobedient they are not equal
32|19|as for those who believed and did righteous deeds for them will be the gardens of refuge as accommodation for what they used to do
32|20|but as for those who defiantly disobeyed their refuge is the fire every time they wish to emerge from it they will be returned to it while it is said to them taste the punishment of the fire which you used to deny
32|21|and we will surely let them taste the nearer punishment short of the greater punishment that perhaps they will repent
32|22|and who is more unjust than one who is reminded of the verses of his lord then he turns away from them indeed we from the criminals will take retribution
32|23|and we certainly gave moses the scripture so do not be in doubt over his meeting and we made the torah guidance for the children of israel
32|24|and we made from among them leaders guiding by our command when they were patient and when they were certain of our signs
32|25|indeed your lord will judge between them on the day of resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ
32|26|has it not become clear to them how many generations we destroyed before them as they walk among their dwellings indeed in that are signs then do they not hear
32|27|have they not seen that we drive the water in clouds to barren land and bring forth thereby crops from which their livestock eat and they themselves then do they not see
32|28|and they say when will be this conquest if you should be truthful
32|29|say o muhammad on the day of conquest the belief of those who had disbelieved will not benefit them nor will they be reprieved
32|30|so turn away from them and wait indeed they are waiting
33|1|o prophet fear allah and do not obey the disbelievers and the hypocrites indeed allah is ever knowing and wise
33|2|and follow that which is revealed to you from your lord indeed allah is ever with what you do acquainted
33|3|and rely upon allah and sufficient is allah as disposer of affairs
33|4|allah has not made for a man two hearts in his interior and he has not made your wives whom you declare unlawful your mothers and he has not made your adopted sons your true sons that is merely your saying by your mouths but allah says the truth and he guides to the right way
33|5|call them by the names of their fathers it is more just in the sight of allah but if you do not know their fathers then they are still your brothers in religion and those entrusted to you and there is no blame upon you for that in which you have erred but only for what your hearts intended and ever is allah forgiving and merciful
33|6|the prophet is more worthy of the believers than themselves and his wives are in the position of their mothers and those of blood relationship are more entitled to inheritance in the decree of allah than the other believers and the emigrants except that you may do to your close associates a kindness through bequest that was in the book inscribed
33|7|and mention o muhammad when we took from the prophets their covenant and from you and from noah and abraham and moses and jesus the son of mary and we took from them a solemn covenant
33|8|that he may question the truthful about their truth and he has prepared for the disbelievers a painful punishment
33|9|o you who have believed remember the favor of allah upon you when armies came to attack you and we sent upon them a wind and armies of angels you did not see and ever is allah of what you do seeing
33|10|remember when they came at you from above you and from below you and when eyes shifted in fear and hearts reached the throats and you assumed about allah various assumptions
33|11|there the believers were tested and shaken with a severe shaking
33|12|and remember when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is disease said allah and his messenger did not promise us except delusion
33|13|and when a faction of them said o people of yathrib there is no stability for you here so return home and a party of them asked permission of the prophet saying indeed our houses are unprotected while they were not exposed they did not intend except to flee
33|14|and if they had been entered upon from all its surrounding regions and fitnah had been demanded of them they would have done it and not hesitated over it except briefly
33|15|and they had already promised allah before not to turn their backs and flee and ever is the promise to allah that about which one will be questioned
33|16|say o muhammad never will fleeing benefit you if you should flee from death or killing and then if you did you would not be given enjoyment of life except for a little
33|17|say who is it that can protect you from allah if he intends for you an ill or intends for you a mercy and they will not find for themselves besides allah any protector or any helper
33|18|already allah knows the hinderers among you and those hypocrites who say to their brothers come to us and do not go to battle except for a few
33|19|indisposed toward you and when fear comes you see them looking at you their eyes revolving like one being overcome by death but when fear departs they lash you with sharp tongues indisposed toward any good those have not believed so allah has rendered their deeds worthless and ever is that for allah easy
33|20|they think the companies have not yet withdrawn and if the companies should come again they would wish they were in the desert among the bedouins inquiring from afar about your news and if they should be among you they would not fight except for a little
33|21|there has certainly been for you in the messenger of allah an excellent pattern for anyone whose hope is in allah and the last day and who remembers allah often
33|22|and when the believers saw the companies they said this is what allah and his messenger had promised us and allah and his messenger spoke the truth and it increased them only in faith and acceptance
33|23|among the believers are men true to what they promised allah among them is he who has fulfilled his vow to the death and among them is he who awaits his chance and they did not alter the terms of their commitment by any alteration
33|24|that allah may reward the truthful for their truth and punish the hypocrites if he wills or accept their repentance indeed allah is ever forgiving and merciful
33|25|and allah repelled those who disbelieved in their rage not having obtained any good and sufficient was allah for the believers in battle and ever is allah powerful and exalted in might
33|26|and he brought down those who supported them among the people of the scripture from their fortresses and cast terror into their hearts so that a party you killed and you took captive a party
33|27|and he caused you to inherit their land and their homes and their properties and a land which you have not trodden and ever is allah over all things competent
33|28|o prophet say to your wives if you should desire the worldly life and its adornment then come i will provide for you and give you a gracious release
33|29|but if you should desire allah and his messenger and the home of the hereafter then indeed allah has prepared for the doers of good among you a great reward
33|30|o wives of the prophet whoever of you should commit a clear immorality for her the punishment would be doubled two fold and ever is that for allah easy
33|31|and whoever of you devoutly obeys allah and his messenger and does righteousness we will give her her reward twice and we have prepared for her a noble provision
33|32|o wives of the prophet you are not like anyone among women if you fear allah then do not be soft in speech to men lest he in whose heart is disease should covet but speak with appropriate speech
33|33|and abide in your houses and do not display yourselves as was the display of the former times of ignorance and establish prayer and give zakah and obey allah and his messenger allah intends only to remove from you the impurity of sin o people of the prophet s household and to purify you with extensive purification
33|34|and remember what is recited in your houses of the verses of allah and wisdom indeed allah is ever subtle and acquainted with all things
33|35|indeed the muslim men and muslim women the believing men and believing women the obedient men and obedient women the truthful men and truthful women the patient men and patient women the humble men and humble women the charitable men and charitable women the fasting men and fasting women the men who guard their private parts and the women who do so and the men who remember allah often and the women who do so for them allah has prepared forgiveness and a great reward
33|36|it is not for a believing man or a believing woman when allah and his messenger have decided a matter that they should thereafter have any choice about their affair and whoever disobeys allah and his messenger has certainly strayed into clear error
33|37|and remember o muhammad when you said to the one on whom allah bestowed favor and you bestowed favor keep your wife and fear allah while you concealed within yourself that which allah is to disclose and you feared the people while allah has more right that you fear him so when zayd had no longer any need for her we married her to you in order that there not be upon the believers any discomfort concerning the wives of their adopted sons when they no longer have need of them and ever is the command of allah accomplished
33|38|there is not to be upon the prophet any discomfort concerning that which allah has imposed upon him this is the established way of allah with those prophets who have passed on before and ever is the command of allah a destiny decreed
33|39|allah praises those who convey the messages of allah and fear him and do not fear anyone but allah and sufficient is allah as accountant
33|40|muhammad is not the father of any one of your men but he is the messenger of allah and last of the prophets and ever is allah of all things knowing
33|41|o you who have believed remember allah with much remembrance
33|42|and exalt him morning and afternoon
33|43|it is he who confers blessing upon you and his angels ask him to do so that he may bring you out from darknesses into the light and ever is he to the believers merciful
33|44|their greeting the day they meet him will be peace and he has prepared for them a noble reward
33|45|o prophet indeed we have sent you as a witness and a bringer of good tidings and a warner
33|46|and one who invites to allah by his permission and an illuminating lamp
33|47|and give good tidings to the believers that they will have from allah great bounty
33|48|and do not obey the disbelievers and the hypocrites but do not harm them and rely upon allah and sufficient is allah as disposer of affairs
33|49|o you who have believed when you marry believing women and then divorce them before you have touched them then there is not for you any waiting period to count concerning them so provide for them and give them a gracious release
33|50|o prophet indeed we have made lawful to you your wives to whom you have given their due compensation and those your right hand possesses from what allah has returned to you of captives and the daughters of your paternal uncles and the daughters of your paternal aunts and the daughters of your maternal uncles and the daughters of your maternal aunts who emigrated with you and a believing woman if she gives herself to the prophet and if the prophet wishes to marry her this is only for you excluding the other believers we certainly know what we have made obligatory upon them concerning their wives and those their right hands possess but this is for you in order that there will be upon you no discomfort and ever is allah forgiving and merciful
33|51|you o muhammad may put aside whom you will of them or take to yourself whom you will and any that you desire of those wives from whom you had temporarily separated there is no blame upon you in returning her that is more suitable that they should be content and not grieve and that they should be satisfied with what you have given them all of them and allah knows what is in your hearts and ever is allah knowing and forbearing
33|52|not lawful to you o muhammad are any additional women after this nor is it for you to exchange them for other wives even if their beauty were to please you except what your right hand possesses and ever is allah over all things an observer
33|53|o you who have believed do not enter the houses of the prophet except when you are permitted for a meal without awaiting its readiness but when you are invited then enter and when you have eaten disperse without seeking to remain for conversation indeed that behavior was troubling the prophet and he is shy of dismissing you but allah is not shy of the truth and when you ask his wives for something ask them from behind a partition that is purer for your hearts and their hearts and it is not conceivable or lawful for you to harm the messenger of allah or to marry his wives after him ever indeed that would be in the sight of allah an enormity
33|54|whether you reveal a thing or conceal it indeed allah is ever of all things knowing
33|55|there is no blame upon women concerning their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their brothers sons or their sisters sons or their women or those their right hands possess and fear allah indeed allah is ever over all things witness
33|56|indeed allah confers blessing upon the prophet and his angels ask him to do so o you who have believed ask allah to confer blessing upon him and ask allah to grant him peace
33|57|indeed those who abuse allah and his messenger allah has cursed them in this world and the hereafter and prepared for them a humiliating punishment
33|58|and those who harm believing men and believing women for something other than what they have earned have certainly born upon themselves a slander and manifest sin
33|59|o prophet tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to bring down over themselves part of their outer garments that is more suitable that they will be known and not be abused and ever is allah forgiving and merciful
33|60|if the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is disease and those who spread rumors in al madinah do not cease we will surely incite you against them then they will not remain your neighbors therein except for a little
33|61|accursed wherever they are found being seized and massacred completely
33|62|this is the established way of allah with those who passed on before and you will not find in the way of allah any change
33|63|people ask you concerning the hour say knowledge of it is only with allah and what may make you perceive perhaps the hour is near
33|64|indeed allah has cursed the disbelievers and prepared for them a blaze
33|65|abiding therein forever they will not find a protector or a helper
33|66|the day their faces will be turned about in the fire they will say how we wish we had obeyed allah and obeyed the messenger
33|67|and they will say our lord indeed we obeyed our masters and our dignitaries and they led us astray from the right way
33|68|our lord give them double the punishment and curse them with a great curse
33|69|o you who have believed be not like those who abused moses then allah cleared him of what they said and he in the sight of allah was distinguished
33|70|o you who have believed fear allah and speak words of appropriate justice
33|71|he will then amend for you your deeds and forgive you your sins and whoever obeys allah and his messenger has certainly attained a great attainment
33|72|indeed we offered the trust to the heavens and the earth and the mountains and they declined to bear it and feared it but man undertook to bear it indeed he was unjust and ignorant
33|73|it was so that allah may punish the hypocrite men and hypocrite women and the men and women who associate others with him and that allah may accept repentance from the believing men and believing women and ever is allah forgiving and merciful
34|1|all praise is due to allah to whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth and to him belongs all praise in the hereafter and he is the wise the acquainted
34|2|he knows what penetrates into the earth and what emerges from it and what descends from the heaven and what ascends therein and he is the merciful the forgiving
34|3|but those who disbelieve say the hour will not come to us say yes by my lord it will surely come to you allah is the knower of the unseen not absent from him is an atom s weight within the heavens or within the earth or what is smaller than that or greater except that it is in a clear register
34|4|that he may reward those who believe and do righteous deeds those will have forgiveness and noble provision
34|5|but those who strive against our verses seeking to cause failure for them will be a painful punishment of foul nature
34|6|and those who have been given knowledge see that what is revealed to you from your lord is the truth and it guides to the path of the exalted in might the praiseworthy
34|7|but those who disbelieve say shall we direct you to a man who will inform you that when you have disintegrated in complete disintegration you will then be recreated in a new creation
34|8|has he invented about allah a lie or is there in him madness rather they who do not believe in the hereafter will be in the punishment and are in extreme error
34|9|then do they not look at what is before them and what is behind them of the heaven and earth if we should will we could cause the earth to swallow them or could let fall upon them fragments from the sky indeed in that is a sign for every servant turning back to allah
34|10|and we certainly gave david from us bounty we said o mountains repeat our praises with him and the birds as well and we made pliable for him iron
34|11|commanding him make full coats of mail and calculate precisely the links and work all of you righteousness indeed i of what you do am seeing
34|12|and to solomon we subjected the wind its morning journey was that of a month and its afternoon journey was that of a month and we made flow for him a spring of liquid copper and among the jinn were those who worked for him by the permission of his lord and whoever deviated among them from our command we will make him taste of the punishment of the blaze
34|13|they made for him what he willed of elevated chambers statues bowls like reservoirs and stationary kettles we said work o family of david in gratitude and few of my servants are grateful
34|14|and when we decreed for solomon death nothing indicated to the jinn his death except a creature of the earth eating his staff but when he fell it became clear to the jinn that if they had known the unseen they would not have remained in humiliating punishment
34|15|there was for the tribe of saba in their dwelling place a sign two fields of gardens on the right and on the left they were told eat from the provisions of your lord and be grateful to him a good land have you and a forgiving lord
34|16|but they turned away refusing so we sent upon them the flood of the dam and we replaced their two fields of gardens with gardens of bitter fruit tamarisks and something of sparse lote trees
34|17|by that we repaid them because they disbelieved and do we thus repay except the ungrateful
34|18|and we placed between them and the cities which we had blessed many visible cities and we determined between them the distances of journey saying travel between them by night or day in safety
34|19|but insolently they said our lord lengthen the distance between our journeys and wronged themselves so we made them narrations and dispersed them in total dispersion indeed in that are signs for everyone patient and grateful
34|20|and iblees had already confirmed through them his assumption so they followed him except for a party of believers
34|21|and he had over them no authority except it was decreed that we might make evident who believes in the hereafter from who is thereof in doubt and your lord over all things is guardian
34|22|say o muhammad invoke those you claim as deities besides allah they do not possess an atom s weight of ability in the heavens or on the earth and they do not have therein any partnership with him nor is there for him from among them any assistant
34|23|and intercession does not benefit with him except for one whom he permits and those wait until when terror is removed from their hearts they will say to one another what has your lord said they will say the truth and he is the most high the grand
34|24|say who provides for you from the heavens and the earth say allah and indeed we or you are either upon guidance or in clear error
34|25|say you will not be asked about what we committed and we will not be asked about what you do
34|26|say our lord will bring us together then he will judge between us in truth and he is the knowing judge
34|27|say show me those whom you have attached to him as partners no rather he alone is allah the exalted in might the wise
34|28|and we have not sent you except comprehensively to mankind as a bringer of good tidings and a warner but most of the people do not know
34|29|and they say when is this promise if you should be truthful
34|30|say for you is the appointment of a day when you will not remain thereafter an hour nor will you precede it
34|31|and those who disbelieve say we will never believe in this qur an nor in that before it but if you could see when the wrongdoers are made to stand before their lord refuting each other s words those who were oppressed will say to those who were arrogant if not for you we would have been believers
34|32|those who were arrogant will say to those who were oppressed did we avert you from guidance after it had come to you rather you were criminals
34|33|those who were oppressed will say to those who were arrogant rather it was your conspiracy of night and day when you were ordering us to disbelieve in allah and attribute to him equals but they will all confide regret when they see the punishment and we will put shackles on the necks of those who disbelieved will they be recompensed except for what they used to do
34|34|and we did not send into a city any warner except that its affluent said indeed we in that with which you were sent are disbelievers
34|35|and they said we are more than the believers in wealth and children and we are not to be punished
34|36|say indeed my lord extends provision for whom he wills and restricts it but most of the people do not know
34|37|and it is not your wealth or your children that bring you nearer to us in position but it is by being one who has believed and done righteousness for them there will be the double reward for what they did and they will be in the upper chambers of paradise safe and secure
34|38|and the ones who strive against our verses to cause them failure those will be brought into the punishment to remain
34|39|say indeed my lord extends provision for whom he wills of his servants and restricts it for him but whatever thing you spend in his cause he will compensate it and he is the best of providers
34|40|and mention the day when he will gather them all and then say to the angels did these people used to worship you
34|41|they will say exalted are you you o allah are our benefactor not them rather they used to worship the jinn most of them were believers in them
34|42|but today you do not hold for one another the power of benefit or harm and we will say to those who wronged taste the punishment of the fire which you used to deny
34|43|and when our verses are recited to them as clear evidences they say this is not but a man who wishes to avert you from that which your fathers were worshipping and they say this is not except a lie invented and those who disbelieve say of the truth when it has come to them this is not but obvious magic
34|44|and we had not given them any scriptures which they could study and we had not sent to them before you o muhammad any warner
34|45|and those before them denied and the people of makkah have not attained a tenth of what we had given them but the former peoples denied my messengers so how terrible was my reproach
34|46|say i only advise you of one thing that you stand for allah seeking truth in pairs and individually and then give thought there is not in your companion any madness he is only a warner to you before a severe punishment
34|47|say whatever payment i might have asked of you it is yours my payment is only from allah and he is over all things witness
34|48|say indeed my lord projects the truth knower of the unseen
34|49|say the truth has come and falsehood can neither begin anything nor repeat it
34|50|say if i should err i would only err against myself but if i am guided it is by what my lord reveals to me indeed he is hearing and near
34|51|and if you could see when they are terrified but there is no escape and they will be seized from a place nearby
34|52|and they will then say we believe in it but how for them will be the taking of faith from a place far away
34|53|and they had already disbelieved in it before and would assault the unseen from a place far away
34|54|and prevention will be placed between them and what they desire as was done with their kind before indeed they were in disquieting denial
35|1|all praise is due to allah creator of the heavens and the earth who made the angels messengers having wings two or three or four he increases in creation what he wills indeed allah is over all things competent
35|2|whatever allah grants to people of mercy none can withhold it and whatever he withholds none can release it thereafter and he is the exalted in might the wise
35|3|o mankind remember the favor of allah upon you is there any creator other than allah who provides for you from the heaven and earth there is no deity except him so how are you deluded
35|4|and if they deny you o muhammad already were messengers denied before you and to allah are returned all matters
35|5|o mankind indeed the promise of allah is truth so let not the worldly life delude you and be not deceived about allah by the deceiver
35|6|indeed satan is an enemy to you so take him as an enemy he only invites his party to be among the companions of the blaze
35|7|those who disbelieve will have a severe punishment and those who believe and do righteous deeds will have forgiveness and great reward
35|8|then is one to whom the evil of his deed has been made attractive so he considers it good like one rightly guided for indeed allah sends astray whom he wills and guides whom he wills so do not let yourself perish over them in regret indeed allah is knowing of what they do
35|9|and it is allah who sends the winds and they stir the clouds and we drive them to a dead land and give life thereby to the earth after its lifelessness thus is the resurrection
35|10|whoever desires honor through power then to allah belongs all honor to him ascends good speech and righteous work raises it but they who plot evil deeds will have a severe punishment and the plotting of those it will perish
35|11|and allah created you from dust then from a sperm drop then he made you mates and no female conceives nor does she give birth except with his knowledge and no aged person is granted additional life nor is his lifespan lessened but that it is in a register indeed that for allah is easy
35|12|and not alike are the two bodies of water one is fresh and sweet palatable for drinking and one is salty and bitter and from each you eat tender meat and extract ornaments which you wear and you see the ships plowing through them that you might seek of his bounty and perhaps you will be grateful
35|13|he causes the night to enter the day and he causes the day to enter the night and has subjected the sun and the moon each running its course for a specified term that is allah your lord to him belongs sovereignty and those whom you invoke other than him do not possess as much as the membrane of a date seed
35|14|if you invoke them they do not hear your supplication and if they heard they would not respond to you and on the day of resurrection they will deny your association and none can inform you like one acquainted with all matters
35|15|o mankind you are those in need of allah while allah is the free of need the praiseworthy
35|16|if he wills he can do away with you and bring forth a new creation
35|17|and that is for allah not difficult
35|18|and no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another and if a heavily laden soul calls another to carry some of its load nothing of it will be carried even if he should be a close relative you can only warn those who fear their lord unseen and have established prayer and whoever purifies himself only purifies himself for the benefit of his soul and to allah is the final destination
35|19|not equal are the blind and the seeing
35|20|nor are the darknesses and the light
35|21|nor are the shade and the heat
35|22|and not equal are the living and the dead indeed allah causes to hear whom he wills but you cannot make hear those in the graves
35|23|you o muhammad are not but a warner
35|24|indeed we have sent you with the truth as a bringer of good tidings and a warner and there was no nation but that there had passed within it a warner
35|25|and if they deny you then already have those before them denied their messengers came to them with clear proofs and written ordinances and with the enlightening scripture
35|26|then i seized the ones who disbelieved and how terrible was my reproach
35|27|do you not see that allah sends down rain from the sky and we produce thereby fruits of varying colors and in the mountains are tracts white and red of varying shades and some extremely black
35|28|and among people and moving creatures and grazing livestock are various colors similarly only those fear allah from among his servants who have knowledge indeed allah is exalted in might and forgiving
35|29|indeed those who recite the book of allah and establish prayer and spend in his cause out of what we have provided them secretly and publicly can expect a profit that will never perish
35|30|that he may give them in full their rewards and increase for them of his bounty indeed he is forgiving and appreciative
35|31|and that which we have revealed to you o muhammad of the book is the truth confirming what was before it indeed allah of his servants is acquainted and seeing
35|32|then we caused to inherit the book those we have chosen of our servants and among them is he who wrongs himself and among them is he who is moderate and among them is he who is foremost in good deeds by permission of allah that inheritance is what is the great bounty
35|33|for them are gardens of perpetual residence which they will enter they will be adorned therein with bracelets of gold and pearls and their garments therein will be silk
35|34|and they will say praise to allah who has removed from us all sorrow indeed our lord is forgiving and appreciative
35|35|he who has settled us in the home of duration out of his bounty there touches us not in it any fatigue and there touches us not in it weariness of mind
35|36|and for those who disbelieve will be the fire of hell death is not decreed for them so they may die nor will its torment be lightened for them thus do we recompense every ungrateful one
35|37|and they will cry out therein our lord remove us we will do righteousness other than what we were doing but did we not grant you life enough for whoever would remember therein to remember and the warner had come to you so taste the punishment for there is not for the wrongdoers any helper
35|38|indeed allah is knower of the unseen aspects of the heavens and earth indeed he is knowing of that within the breasts
35|39|it is he who has made you successors upon the earth and whoever disbelieves upon him will be the consequence of his disbelief and the disbelief of the disbelievers does not increase them in the sight of their lord except in hatred and the disbelief of the disbelievers does not increase them except in loss
35|40|say have you considered your partners whom you invoke besides allah show me what they have created from the earth or have they partnership with him in the heavens or have we given them a book so they are standing on evidence therefrom no rather the wrongdoers do not promise each other except delusion
35|41|indeed allah holds the heavens and the earth lest they cease and if they should cease no one could hold them in place after him indeed he is forbearing and forgiving
35|42|and they swore by allah their strongest oaths that if a warner came to them they would be more guided than any one of the previous nations but when a warner came to them it did not increase them except in aversion
35|43|due to arrogance in the land and plotting of evil but the evil plot does not encompass except its own people then do they await except the way of the former peoples but you will never find in the way of allah any change and you will never find in the way of allah any alteration
35|44|have they not traveled through the land and observed how was the end of those before them and they were greater than them in power but allah is not to be caused failure by anything in the heavens or on the earth indeed he is ever knowing and competent
35|45|and if allah were to impose blame on the people for what they have earned he would not leave upon the earth any creature but he defers them for a specified term and when their time comes then indeed allah has ever been of his servants seeing
36|1|ya seen
36|2|by the wise qur an
36|3|indeed you o muhammad are from among the messengers
36|4|on a straight path
36|5|this is a revelation of the exalted in might the merciful
36|6|that you may warn a people whose forefathers were not warned so they are unaware
36|7|already the word has come into effect upon most of them so they do not believe
36|8|indeed we have put shackles on their necks and they are to their chins so they are with heads kept aloft
36|9|and we have put before them a barrier and behind them a barrier and covered them so they do not see
36|10|and it is all the same for them whether you warn them or do not warn them they will not believe
36|11|you can only warn one who follows the message and fears the most merciful unseen so give him good tidings of forgiveness and noble reward
36|12|indeed it is we who bring the dead to life and record what they have put forth and what they left behind and all things we have enumerated in a clear register
36|13|and present to them an example the people of the city when the messengers came to it
36|14|when we sent to them two but they denied them so we strengthened them with a third and they said indeed we are messengers to you
36|15|they said you are not but human beings like us and the most merciful has not revealed a thing you are only telling lies
36|16|they said our lord knows that we are messengers to you
36|17|and we are not responsible except for clear notification
36|18|they said indeed we consider you a bad omen if you do not desist we will surely stone you and there will surely touch you from us a painful punishment
36|19|they said your omen is with yourselves is it because you were reminded rather you are a transgressing people
36|20|and there came from the farthest end of the city a man running he said o my people follow the messengers
36|21|follow those who do not ask of you any payment and they are rightly guided
36|22|and why should i not worship he who created me and to whom you will be returned
36|23|should i take other than him false deities while if the most merciful intends for me some adversity their intercession will not avail me at all nor can they save me
36|24|indeed i would then be in manifest error
36|25|indeed i have believed in your lord so listen to me
36|26|it was said enter paradise he said i wish my people could know
36|27|of how my lord has forgiven me and placed me among the honored
36|28|and we did not send down upon his people after him any soldiers from the heaven nor would we have done so
36|29|it was not but one shout and immediately they were extinguished
36|30|how regretful for the servants there did not come to them any messenger except that they used to ridicule him
36|31|have they not considered how many generations we destroyed before them that they to them will not return
36|32|and indeed all of them will yet be brought present before us
36|33|and a sign for them is the dead earth we have brought it to life and brought forth from it grain and from it they eat
36|34|and we placed therein gardens of palm trees and grapevines and caused to burst forth therefrom some springs
36|35|that they may eat of his fruit and their hands have not produced it so will they not be grateful
36|36|exalted is he who created all pairs from what the earth grows and from themselves and from that which they do not know
36|37|and a sign for them is the night we remove from it the light of day so they are left in darkness
36|38|and the sun runs on course toward its stopping point that is the determination of the exalted in might the knowing
36|39|and the moon we have determined for it phases until it returns appearing like the old date stalk
36|40|it is not allowable for the sun to reach the moon nor does the night overtake the day but each in an orbit is swimming
36|41|and a sign for them is that we carried their forefathers in a laden ship
36|42|and we created for them from the likes of it that which they ride
36|43|and if we should will we could drown them then no one responding to a cry would there be for them nor would they be saved
36|44|except as a mercy from us and provision for a time
36|45|but when it is said to them beware of what is before you and what is behind you perhaps you will receive mercy
36|46|and no sign comes to them from the signs of their lord except that they are from it turning away
36|47|and when it is said to them spend from that which allah has provided for you those who disbelieve say to those who believe should we feed one whom if allah had willed he would have fed you are not but in clear error
36|48|and they say when is this promise if you should be truthful
36|49|they do not await except one blast which will seize them while they are disputing
36|50|and they will not be able to give any instruction nor to their people can they return
36|51|and the horn will be blown and at once from the graves to their lord they will hasten
36|52|they will say o woe to us who has raised us up from our sleeping place the reply will be this is what the most merciful had promised and the messengers told the truth
36|53|it will not be but one blast and at once they are all brought present before us
36|54|so today no soul will be wronged at all and you will not be recompensed except for what you used to do
36|55|indeed the companions of paradise that day will be amused in joyful occupation
36|56|they and their spouses in shade reclining on adorned couches
36|57|for them therein is fruit and for them is whatever they request or wish
36|58|and peace a word from a merciful lord
36|59|then he will say but stand apart today you criminals
36|60|did i not enjoin upon you o children of adam that you not worship satan for indeed he is to you a clear enemy
36|61|and that you worship only me this is a straight path
36|62|and he had already led astray from among you much of creation so did you not use reason
36|63|this is the hellfire which you were promised
36|64|enter to burn therein today for what you used to deny
36|65|that day we will seal over their mouths and their hands will speak to us and their feet will testify about what they used to earn
36|66|and if we willed we could have obliterated their eyes and they would race to find the path and how could they see
36|67|and if we willed we could have deformed them paralyzing them in their places so they would not be able to proceed nor could they return
36|68|and he to whom we grant long life we reverse in creation so will they not understand
36|69|and we did not give prophet muhammad knowledge of poetry nor is it befitting for him it is not but a message and a clear qur an
36|70|to warn whoever is alive and justify the word against the disbelievers
36|71|do they not see that we have created for them from what our hands have made grazing livestock and then they are their owners
36|72|and we have tamed them for them so some of them they ride and some of them they eat
36|73|and for them therein are other benefits and drinks so will they not be grateful
36|74|but they have taken besides allah false deities that perhaps they would be helped
36|75|they are not able to help them and they themselves are for them soldiers in attendance
36|76|so let not their speech grieve you indeed we know what they conceal and what they declare
36|77|does man not consider that we created him from a mere sperm drop then at once he is a clear adversary
36|78|and he presents for us an example and forgets his own creation he says who will give life to bones while they are disintegrated
36|79|say he will give them life who produced them the first time and he is of all creation knowing
36|80|it is he who made for you from the green tree fire and then from it you ignite
36|81|is not he who created the heavens and the earth able to create the likes of them yes it is so and he is the knowing creator
36|82|his command is only when he intends a thing that he says to it be and it is
36|83|so exalted is he in whose hand is the realm of all things and to him you will be returned
37|1|by those angels lined up in rows
37|2|and those who drive the clouds
37|3|and those who recite the message
37|4|indeed your god is one
37|5|lord of the heavens and the earth and that between them and lord of the sunrises
37|6|indeed we have adorned the nearest heaven with an adornment of stars
37|7|and as protection against every rebellious devil
37|8|so they may not listen to the exalted assembly of angels and are pelted from every side
37|9|repelled and for them is a constant punishment
37|10|except one who snatches some words by theft but they are pursued by a burning flame piercing in brightness
37|11|then inquire of them o muhammad are they a stronger or more difficult creation or those others we have created indeed we created men from sticky clay
37|12|but you wonder while they mock
37|13|and when they are reminded they remember not
37|14|and when they see a sign they ridicule
37|15|and say this is not but obvious magic
37|16|when we have died and become dust and bones are we indeed to be resurrected
37|17|and our forefathers as well
37|18|say yes and you will be rendered contemptible
37|19|it will be only one shout and at once they will be observing
37|20|they will say o woe to us this is the day of recompense
37|21|they will be told this is the day of judgement which you used to deny
37|22|the angels will be ordered gather those who committed wrong their kinds and what they used to worship
37|23|other than allah and guide them to the path of hellfire
37|24|and stop them indeed they are to be questioned
37|25|they will be asked what is wrong with you why do you not help each other
37|26|but they that day are in surrender
37|27|and they will approach one another blaming each other
37|28|they will say indeed you used to come at us from the right
37|29|the oppressors will say rather you yourselves were not believers
37|30|and we had over you no authority but you were a transgressing people
37|31|so the word of our lord has come into effect upon us indeed we will taste punishment
37|32|and we led you to deviation indeed we were deviators
37|33|so indeed they that day will be sharing in the punishment
37|34|indeed that is how we deal with the criminals
37|35|indeed they when it was said to them there is no deity but allah were arrogant
37|36|and were saying are we to leave our gods for a mad poet
37|37|rather the prophet has come with the truth and confirmed the previous messengers
37|38|indeed you disbelievers will be tasters of the painful punishment
37|39|and you will not be recompensed except for what you used to do
37|40|but not the chosen servants of allah
37|41|those will have a provision determined
37|42|fruits and they will be honored
37|43|in gardens of pleasure
37|44|on thrones facing one another
37|45|there will be circulated among them a cup of wine from a flowing spring
37|46|white and delicious to the drinkers
37|47|no bad effect is there in it nor from it will they be intoxicated
37|48|and with them will be women limiting their glances with large beautiful eyes
37|49|as if they were delicate eggs well protected
37|50|and they will approach one another inquiring of each other
37|51|a speaker among them will say indeed i had a companion on earth
37|52|who would say are you indeed of those who believe
37|53|that when we have died and become dust and bones we will indeed be recompensed
37|54|he will say would you care to look
37|55|and he will look and see him in the midst of the hellfire
37|56|he will say by allah you almost ruined me
37|57|if not for the favor of my lord i would have been of those brought in to hell
37|58|then are we not to die
37|59|except for our first death and we will not be punished
37|60|indeed this is the great attainment
37|61|for the like of this let the workers on earth work
37|62|is paradise a better accommodation or the tree of zaqqum
37|63|indeed we have made it a torment for the wrongdoers
37|64|indeed it is a tree issuing from the bottom of the hellfire
37|65|its emerging fruit as if it was heads of the devils
37|66|and indeed they will eat from it and fill with it their bellies
37|67|then indeed they will have after it a mixture of scalding water
37|68|then indeed their return will be to the hellfire
37|69|indeed they found their fathers astray
37|70|so they hastened to follow in their footsteps
37|71|and there had already strayed before them most of the former peoples
37|72|and we had already sent among them warners
37|73|then look how was the end of those who were warned
37|74|but not the chosen servants of allah
37|75|and noah had certainly called us and we are the best of responders
37|76|and we saved him and his family from the great affliction
37|77|and we made his descendants those remaining on the earth
37|78|and left for him favorable mention among later generations
37|79|peace upon noah among the worlds
37|80|indeed we thus reward the doers of good
37|81|indeed he was of our believing servants
37|82|then we drowned the disbelievers
37|83|and indeed among his kind was abraham
37|84|when he came to his lord with a sound heart
37|85|and when he said to his father and his people what do you worship
37|86|is it falsehood as gods other than allah you desire
37|87|then what is your thought about the lord of the worlds
37|88|and he cast a look at the stars
37|89|and said indeed i am about to be ill
37|90|so they turned away from him departing
37|91|then he turned to their gods and said do you not eat
37|92|what is wrong with you that you do not speak
37|93|and he turned upon them a blow with his right hand
37|94|then the people came toward him hastening
37|95|he said do you worship that which you yourselves carve
37|96|while allah created you and that which you do
37|97|they said construct for him a furnace and throw him into the burning fire
37|98|and they intended for him a plan but we made them the most debased
37|99|and then he said indeed i will go to where i am ordered by my lord he will guide me
37|100|my lord grant me a child from among the righteous
37|101|so we gave him good tidings of a forbearing boy
37|102|and when he reached with him the age of exertion he said o my son indeed i have seen in a dream that i must sacrifice you so see what you think he said o my father do as you are commanded you will find me if allah wills of the steadfast
37|103|and when they had both submitted and he put him down upon his forehead
37|104|we called to him o abraham
37|105|you have fulfilled the vision indeed we thus reward the doers of good
37|106|indeed this was the clear trial
37|107|and we ransomed him with a great sacrifice
37|108|and we left for him favorable mention among later generations
37|109|peace upon abraham
37|110|indeed we thus reward the doers of good
37|111|indeed he was of our believing servants
37|112|and we gave him good tidings of isaac a prophet from among the righteous
37|113|and we blessed him and isaac but among their descendants is the doer of good and the clearly unjust to himself
37|114|and we did certainly confer favor upon moses and aaron
37|115|and we saved them and their people from the great affliction
37|116|and we supported them so it was they who overcame
37|117|and we gave them the explicit scripture
37|118|and we guided them on the straight path
37|119|and we left for them favorable mention among later generations
37|120|peace upon moses and aaron
37|121|indeed we thus reward the doers of good
37|122|indeed they were of our believing servants
37|123|and indeed elias was from among the messengers
37|124|when he said to his people will you not fear allah
37|125|do you call upon ba l and leave the best of creators
37|126|allah your lord and the lord of your first forefathers
37|127|and they denied him so indeed they will be brought for punishment
37|128|except the chosen servants of allah
37|129|and we left for him favorable mention among later generations
37|130|peace upon elias
37|131|indeed we thus reward the doers of good
37|132|indeed he was of our believing servants
37|133|and indeed lot was among the messengers
37|134|so mention when we saved him and his family all
37|135|except his wife among those who remained with the evildoers
37|136|then we destroyed the others
37|137|and indeed you pass by them in the morning
37|138|and at night then will you not use reason
37|139|and indeed jonah was among the messengers
37|140|mention when he ran away to the laden ship
37|141|and he drew lots and was among the losers
37|142|then the fish swallowed him while he was blameworthy
37|143|and had he not been of those who exalt allah
37|144|he would have remained inside its belly until the day they are resurrected
37|145|but we threw him onto the open shore while he was ill
37|146|and we caused to grow over him a gourd vine
37|147|and we sent him to his people of a hundred thousand or more
37|148|and they believed so we gave them enjoyment of life for a time
37|149|so inquire of them o muhammad does your lord have daughters while they have sons
37|150|or did we create the angels as females while they were witnesses
37|151|unquestionably it is out of their invented falsehood that they say
37|152|allah has begotten and indeed they are liars
37|153|has he chosen daughters over sons
37|154|what is wrong with you how do you make judgement
37|155|then will you not be reminded
37|156|or do you have a clear authority
37|157|then produce your scripture if you should be truthful
37|158|and they have claimed between him and the jinn a lineage but the jinn have already known that they who made such claims will be brought to punishment
37|159|exalted is allah above what they describe
37|160|except the chosen servants of allah who do not share in that sin
37|161|so indeed you disbelievers and whatever you worship
37|162|you cannot tempt anyone away from him
37|163|except he who is to enter and burn in the hellfire
37|164|the angels say there is not among us any except that he has a known position
37|165|and indeed we are those who line up for prayer
37|166|and indeed we are those who exalt allah
37|167|and indeed the disbelievers used to say
37|168|if we had a message from those of the former peoples
37|169|we would have been the chosen servants of allah
37|170|but they disbelieved in it so they are going to know
37|171|and our word has already preceded for our servants the messengers
37|172|that indeed they would be those given victory
37|173|and that indeed our soldiers will be those who overcome
37|174|so o muhammad leave them for a time
37|175|and see what will befall them for they are going to see
37|176|then for our punishment are they impatient
37|177|but when it descends in their territory then evil is the morning of those who were warned
37|178|and leave them for a time
37|179|and see for they are going to see
37|180|exalted is your lord the lord of might above what they describe
37|181|and peace upon the messengers
37|182|and praise to allah lord of the worlds
38|1|sad by the qur an containing reminder
38|2|but those who disbelieve are in pride and dissension
38|3|how many a generation have we destroyed before them and they then called out but it was not a time for escape
38|4|and they wonder that there has come to them a warner from among themselves and the disbelievers say this is a magician and a liar
38|5|has he made the gods only one god indeed this is a curious thing
38|6|and the eminent among them went forth saying continue and be patient over the defense of your gods indeed this is a thing intended
38|7|we have not heard of this in the latest religion this is not but a fabrication
38|8|has the message been revealed to him out of all of us rather they are in doubt about my message rather they have not yet tasted my punishment
38|9|or do they have the depositories of the mercy of your lord the exalted in might the bestower
38|10|or is theirs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and what is between them then let them ascend through any ways of access
38|11|they are but soldiers who will be defeated there among the companies of disbelievers
38|12|the people of noah denied before them and the tribe of aad and pharaoh the owner of stakes
38|13|and the tribe of thamud and the people of lot and the companions of the thicket those are the companies
38|14|each of them denied the messengers so my penalty was justified
38|15|and these disbelievers await not but one blast of the horn for it there will be no delay
38|16|and they say our lord hasten for us our share of the punishment before the day of account
38|17|be patient over what they say and remember our servant david the possessor of strength indeed he was one who repeatedly turned back to allah
38|18|indeed we subjected the mountains to praise with him exalting allah in the late afternoon and after sunrise
38|19|and the birds were assembled all with him repeating praises
38|20|and we strengthened his kingdom and gave him wisdom and discernment in speech
38|21|and has there come to you the news of the adversaries when they climbed over the wall of his prayer chamber
38|22|when they entered upon david and he was alarmed by them they said fear not we are two adversaries one of whom has wronged the other so judge between us with truth and do not exceed it and guide us to the sound path
38|23|indeed this my brother has ninety nine ewes and i have one ewe so he said entrust her to me and he overpowered me in speech
38|24|david said he has certainly wronged you in demanding your ewe in addition to his ewes and indeed many associates oppress one another except for those who believe and do righteous deeds and few are they and david became certain that we had tried him and he asked forgiveness of his lord and fell down bowing in prostration and turned in repentance to allah
38|25|so we forgave him that and indeed for him is nearness to us and a good place of return
38|26|we said o david indeed we have made you a successor upon the earth so judge between the people in truth and do not follow your own desire as it will lead you astray from the way of allah indeed those who go astray from the way of allah will have a severe punishment for having forgotten the day of account
38|27|and we did not create the heaven and the earth and that between them aimlessly that is the assumption of those who disbelieve so woe to those who disbelieve from the fire
38|28|or should we treat those who believe and do righteous deeds like corrupters in the land or should we treat those who fear allah like the wicked
38|29|this is a blessed book which we have revealed to you o muhammad that they might reflect upon its verses and that those of understanding would be reminded
38|30|and to david we gave solomon an excellent servant indeed he was one repeatedly turning back to allah
38|31|mention when there were exhibited before him in the afternoon the poised standing racehorses
38|32|and he said indeed i gave preference to the love of good things over the remembrance of my lord until the sun disappeared into the curtain of darkness
38|33|he said return them to me and set about striking their legs and necks
38|34|and we certainly tried solomon and placed on his throne a body then he returned
38|35|he said my lord forgive me and grant me a kingdom such as will not belong to anyone after me indeed you are the bestower
38|36|so we subjected to him the wind blowing by his command gently wherever he directed
38|37|and also the devils of jinn every builder and diver
38|38|and others bound together in shackles
38|39|we said this is our gift so grant or withhold without account
38|40|and indeed for him is nearness to us and a good place of return
38|41|and remember our servant job when he called to his lord indeed satan has touched me with hardship and torment
38|42|so he was told strike the ground with your foot this is a spring for a cool bath and drink
38|43|and we granted him his family and a like number with them as mercy from us and a reminder for those of understanding
38|44|we said and take in your hand a bunch of grass and strike with it and do not break your oath indeed we found him patient an excellent servant indeed he was one repeatedly turning back to allah
38|45|and remember our servants abraham isaac and jacob those of strength and religious vision
38|46|indeed we chose them for an exclusive quality remembrance of the home of the hereafter
38|47|and indeed they are to us among the chosen and outstanding
38|48|and remember ishmael elisha and dhul kifl and all are among the outstanding
38|49|this is a reminder and indeed for the righteous is a good place of return
38|50|gardens of perpetual residence whose doors will be opened to them
38|51|reclining within them they will call therein for abundant fruit and drink
38|52|and with them will be women limiting their glances and of equal age
38|53|this is what you the righteous are promised for the day of account
38|54|indeed this is our provision for it there is no depletion
38|55|this is so but indeed for the transgressors is an evil place of return
38|56|hell which they will enter to burn and wretched is the resting place
38|57|this so let them taste it is scalding water and foul purulence
38|58|and other punishments of its type in various kinds
38|59|its inhabitants will say this is a company bursting in with you no welcome for them indeed they will burn in the fire
38|60|they will say nor you no welcome for you you our leaders brought this upon us and wretched is the settlement
38|61|they will say our lord whoever brought this upon us increase for him double punishment in the fire
38|62|and they will say why do we not see men whom we used to count among the worst
38|63|is it because we took them in ridicule or has our vision turned away from them
38|64|indeed that is truth the quarreling of the people of the fire
38|65|say o muhammad i am only a warner and there is not any deity except allah the one the prevailing
38|66|lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them the exalted in might the perpetual forgiver
38|67|say it is great news
38|68|from which you turn away
38|69|i had no knowledge of the exalted assembly of angels when they were disputing the creation of adam
38|70|it has not been revealed to me except that i am a clear warner
38|71|so mention when your lord said to the angels indeed i am going to create a human being from clay
38|72|so when i have proportioned him and breathed into him of my created soul then fall down to him in prostration
38|73|so the angels prostrated all of them entirely
38|74|except iblees he was arrogant and became among the disbelievers
38|75|allah said o iblees what prevented you from prostrating to that which i created with my hands were you arrogant then or were you already among the haughty
38|76|he said i am better than him you created me from fire and created him from clay
38|77|allah said then get out of paradise for indeed you are expelled
38|78|and indeed upon you is my curse until the day of recompense
38|79|he said my lord then reprieve me until the day they are resurrected
38|80|allah said so indeed you are of those reprieved
38|81|until the day of the time well known
38|82|iblees said by your might i will surely mislead them all
38|83|except among them your chosen servants
38|84|allah said the truth is my oath and the truth i say
38|85|that i will surely fill hell with you and those of them that follow you all together
38|86|say o muhammad i do not ask you for the qur an any payment and i am not of the pretentious
38|87|it is but a reminder to the worlds
38|88|and you will surely know the truth of its information after a time
39|1|the revelation of the qur an is from allah the exalted in might the wise
39|2|indeed we have sent down to you the book o muhammad in truth so worship allah being sincere to him in religion
39|3|unquestionably for allah is the pure religion and those who take protectors besides him say we only worship them that they may bring us nearer to allah in position indeed allah will judge between them concerning that over which they differ indeed allah does not guide he who is a liar and confirmed disbeliever
39|4|if allah had intended to take a son he could have chosen from what he creates whatever he willed exalted is he he is allah the one the prevailing
39|5|he created the heavens and earth in truth he wraps the night over the day and wraps the day over the night and has subjected the sun and the moon each running its course for a specified term unquestionably he is the exalted in might the perpetual forgiver
39|6|he created you from one soul then he made from it its mate and he produced for you from the grazing livestock eight mates he creates you in the wombs of your mothers creation after creation within three darknesses that is allah your lord to him belongs dominion there is no deity except him so how are you averted
39|7|if you disbelieve indeed allah is free from need of you and he does not approve for his servants disbelief and if you are grateful he approves it for you and no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another then to your lord is your return and he will inform you about what you used to do indeed he is knowing of that within the breasts
39|8|and when adversity touches man he calls upon his lord turning to him alone then when he bestows on him a favor from himself he forgets him whom he called upon before and he attributes to allah equals to mislead people from his way say enjoy your disbelief for a little indeed you are of the companions of the fire
39|9|is one who is devoutly obedient during periods of the night prostrating and standing in prayer fearing the hereafter and hoping for the mercy of his lord like one who does not say are those who know equal to those who do not know only they will remember who are people of understanding
39|10|say o my servants who have believed fear your lord for those who do good in this world is good and the earth of allah is spacious indeed the patient will be given their reward without account
39|11|say o muhammad indeed i have been commanded to worship allah being sincere to him in religion
39|12|and i have been commanded to be the first among you of the muslims
39|13|say indeed i fear if i should disobey my lord the punishment of a tremendous day
39|14|say allah alone do i worship sincere to him in my religion
39|15|so worship what you will besides him say indeed the losers are the ones who will lose themselves and their families on the day of resurrection unquestionably that is the manifest loss
39|16|they will have canopies of fire above them and below them canopies by that allah threatens his servants o my servants then fear me
39|17|but those who have avoided taghut lest they worship it and turned back to allah for them are good tidings so give good tidings to my servants
39|18|who listen to speech and follow the best of it those are the ones allah has guided and those are people of understanding
39|19|then is one who has deserved the decree of punishment to be guided then can you save one who is in the fire
39|20|but those who have feared their lord for them are chambers above them chambers built high beneath which rivers flow this is the promise of allah allah does not fail in his promise
39|21|do you not see that allah sends down rain from the sky and makes it flow as springs and rivers in the earth then he produces thereby crops of varying colors then they dry and you see them turned yellow then he makes them scattered debris indeed in that is a reminder for those of understanding
39|22|so is one whose breast allah has expanded to accept islam and he is upon a light from his lord like one whose heart rejects it then woe to those whose hearts are hardened against the remembrance of allah those are in manifest error
39|23|allah has sent down the best statement a consistent book wherein is reiteration the skins shiver therefrom of those who fear their lord then their skins and their hearts relax at the remembrance of allah that is the guidance of allah by which he guides whom he wills and one whom allah leaves astray for him there is no guide
39|24|then is he who will shield with his face the worst of the punishment on the day of resurrection like one secure from it and it will be said to the wrongdoers taste what you used to earn
39|25|those before them denied and punishment came upon them from where they did not perceive
39|26|so allah made them taste disgrace in worldly life but the punishment of the hereafter is greater if they only knew
39|27|and we have certainly presented for the people in this qur an from every kind of example that they might remember
39|28|it is an arabic qur an without any deviance that they might become righteous
39|29|allah presents an example a slave owned by quarreling partners and another belonging exclusively to one man are they equal in comparison praise be to allah but most of them do not know
39|30|indeed you are to die and indeed they are to die
39|31|then indeed you on the day of resurrection before your lord will dispute
39|32|so who is more unjust than one who lies about allah and denies the truth when it has come to him is there not in hell a residence for the disbelievers
39|33|and the one who has brought the truth and they who believed in it those are the righteous
39|34|they will have whatever they desire with their lord that is the reward of the doers of good
39|35|that allah may remove from them the worst of what they did and reward them their due for the best of what they used to do
39|36|is not allah sufficient for his servant prophet muhammad and yet they threaten you with those they worship other than him and whoever allah leaves astray for him there is no guide
39|37|and whoever allah guides for him there is no misleader is not allah exalted in might and owner of retribution
39|38|and if you asked them who created the heavens and the earth they would surely say allah say then have you considered what you invoke besides allah if allah intended me harm are they removers of his harm or if he intended me mercy are they withholders of his mercy say sufficient for me is allah upon him alone rely the wise reliers
39|39|say o my people work according to your position for indeed i am working and you are going to know
39|40|to whom will come a torment disgracing him and on whom will descend an enduring punishment
39|41|indeed we sent down to you the book for the people in truth so whoever is guided it is for the benefit of his soul and whoever goes astray only goes astray to its detriment and you are not a manager over them
39|42|allah takes the souls at the time of their death and those that do not die he takes during their sleep then he keeps those for which he has decreed death and releases the others for a specified term indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought
39|43|or have they taken other than allah as intercessors say even though they do not possess power over anything nor do they reason
39|44|say to allah belongs the right to allow intercession entirely to him belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth then to him you will be returned
39|45|and when allah is mentioned alone the hearts of those who do not believe in the hereafter shrink with aversion but when those worshipped other than him are mentioned immediately they rejoice
39|46|say o allah creator of the heavens and the earth knower of the unseen and the witnessed you will judge between your servants concerning that over which they used to differ
39|47|and if those who did wrong had all that is in the earth entirely and the like of it with it they would attempt to ransom themselves thereby from the worst of the punishment on the day of resurrection and there will appear to them from allah that which they had not taken into account
39|48|and there will appear to them the evils they had earned and they will be enveloped by what they used to ridicule
39|49|and when adversity touches man he calls upon us then when we bestow on him a favor from us he says i have only been given it because of my knowledge rather it is a trial but most of them do not know
39|50|those before them had already said it but they were not availed by what they used to earn
39|51|and the evil consequences of what they earned struck them and those who have wronged of these people will be afflicted by the evil consequences of what they earned and they will not cause failure
39|52|do they not know that allah extends provision for whom he wills and restricts it indeed in that are signs for a people who believe
39|53|say o my servants who have transgressed against themselves by sinning do not despair of the mercy of allah indeed allah forgives all sins indeed it is he who is the forgiving the merciful
39|54|and return in repentance to your lord and submit to him before the punishment comes upon you then you will not be helped
39|55|and follow the best of what was revealed to you from your lord before the punishment comes upon you suddenly while you do not perceive
39|56|lest a soul should say oh how great is my regret over what i neglected in regard to allah and that i was among the mockers
39|57|or lest it say if only allah had guided me i would have been among the righteous
39|58|or lest it say when it sees the punishment if only i had another turn so i could be among the doers of good
39|59|but yes there had come to you my verses but you denied them and were arrogant and you were among the disbelievers
39|60|and on the day of resurrection you will see those who lied about allah with their faces blackened is there not in hell a residence for the arrogant
39|61|and allah will save those who feared him by their attainment no evil will touch them nor will they grieve
39|62|allah is the creator of all things and he is over all things disposer of affairs
39|63|to him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth and they who disbelieve in the verses of allah it is those who are the losers
39|64|say o muhammad is it other than allah that you order me to worship o ignorant ones
39|65|and it was already revealed to you and to those before you that if you should associate anything with allah your work would surely become worthless and you would surely be among the losers
39|66|rather worship only allah and be among the grateful
39|67|they have not appraised allah with true appraisal while the earth entirely will be within his grip on the day of resurrection and the heavens will be folded in his right hand exalted is he and high above what they associate with him
39|68|and the horn will be blown and whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth will fall dead except whom allah wills then it will be blown again and at once they will be standing looking on
39|69|and the earth will shine with the light of its lord and the record of deeds will be placed and the prophets and the witnesses will be brought and it will be judged between them in truth and they will not be wronged
39|70|and every soul will be fully compensated for what it did and he is most knowing of what they do
39|71|and those who disbelieved will be driven to hell in groups until when they reach it its gates are opened and its keepers will say did there not come to you messengers from yourselves reciting to you the verses of your lord and warning you of the meeting of this day of yours they will say yes but the word of punishment has come into effect upon the disbelievers
39|72|to them it will be said enter the gates of hell to abide eternally therein and wretched is the residence of the arrogant
39|73|but those who feared their lord will be driven to paradise in groups until when they reach it while its gates have been opened and its keepers say peace be upon you you have become pure so enter it to abide eternally therein they will enter
39|74|and they will say praise to allah who has fulfilled for us his promise and made us inherit the earth so we may settle in paradise wherever we will and excellent is the reward of righteous workers
39|75|and you will see the angels surrounding the throne exalting allah with praise of their lord and it will be judged between them in truth and it will be said all praise to allah lord of the worlds
40|1|ha meem
40|2|the revelation of the book is from allah the exalted in might the knowing
40|3|the forgiver of sin acceptor of repentance severe in punishment owner of abundance there is no deity except him to him is the destination
40|4|no one disputes concerning the signs of allah except those who disbelieve so be not deceived by their uninhibited movement throughout the land
40|5|the people of noah denied before them and the disbelieving factions after them and every nation intended a plot for their messenger to seize him and they disputed by using falsehood to attempt to invalidate thereby the truth so i seized them and how terrible was my penalty
40|6|and thus has the word of your lord come into effect upon those who disbelieved that they are companions of the fire
40|7|those angels who carry the throne and those around it exalt allah with praise of their lord and believe in him and ask forgiveness for those who have believed saying our lord you have encompassed all things in mercy and knowledge so forgive those who have repented and followed your way and protect them from the punishment of hellfire
40|8|our lord and admit them to gardens of perpetual residence which you have promised them and whoever was righteous among their fathers their spouses and their offspring indeed it is you who is the exalted in might the wise
40|9|and protect them from the evil consequences of their deeds and he whom you protect from evil consequences that day you will have given him mercy and that is the great attainment
40|10|indeed those who disbelieve will be addressed the hatred of allah for you was even greater than your hatred of yourselves this day in hell when you were invited to faith but you refused
40|11|they will say our lord you made us lifeless twice and gave us life twice and we have confessed our sins so is there to an exit any way
40|12|they will be told that is because when allah was called upon alone you disbelieved but if others were associated with him you believed so the judgement is with allah the most high the grand
40|13|it is he who shows you his signs and sends down to you from the sky provision but none will remember except he who turns back in repentance
40|14|so invoke allah being sincere to him in religion although the disbelievers dislike it
40|15|he is the exalted above all degrees owner of the throne he places the inspiration of his command upon whom he wills of his servants to warn of the day of meeting
40|16|the day they come forth nothing concerning them will be concealed from allah to whom belongs all sovereignty this day to allah the one the prevailing
40|17|this day every soul will be recompensed for what it earned no injustice today indeed allah is swift in account
40|18|and warn them o muhammad of the approaching day when hearts are at the throats filled with distress for the wrongdoers there will be no devoted friend and no intercessor who is obeyed
40|19|he knows that which deceives the eyes and what the breasts conceal
40|20|and allah judges with truth while those they invoke besides him judge not with anything indeed allah he is the hearing the seeing
40|21|have they not traveled through the land and observed how was the end of those who were before them they were greater than them in strength and in impression on the land but allah seized them for their sins and they had not from allah any protector
40|22|that was because their messengers were coming to them with clear proofs but they disbelieved so allah seized them indeed he is powerful and severe in punishment
40|23|and we did certainly send moses with our signs and a clear authority
40|24|to pharaoh haman and qarun but they said he is a magician and a liar
40|25|and when he brought them the truth from us they said kill the sons of those who have believed with him and keep their women alive but the plan of the disbelievers is not except in error
40|26|and pharaoh said let me kill moses and let him call upon his lord indeed i fear that he will change your religion or that he will cause corruption in the land
40|27|but moses said indeed i have sought refuge in my lord and your lord from every arrogant one who does not believe in the day of account
40|28|and a believing man from the family of pharaoh who concealed his faith said do you kill a man merely because he says my lord is allah while he has brought you clear proofs from your lord and if he should be lying then upon him is the consequence of his lie but if he should be truthful there will strike you some of what he promises you indeed allah does not guide one who is a transgressor and a liar
40|29|o my people sovereignty is yours today your being dominant in the land but who would protect us from the punishment of allah if it came to us pharaoh said i do not show you except what i see and i do not guide you except to the way of right conduct
40|30|and he who believed said o my people indeed i fear for you a fate like the day of the companies
40|31|like the custom of the people of noah and of aad and thamud and those after them and allah wants no injustice for his servants
40|32|and o my people indeed i fear for you the day of calling
40|33|the day you will turn your backs fleeing there is not for you from allah any protector and whoever allah leaves astray there is not for him any guide
40|34|and joseph had already come to you before with clear proofs but you remained in doubt of that which he brought to you until when he died you said never will allah send a messenger after him thus does allah leave astray he who is a transgressor and skeptic
40|35|those who dispute concerning the signs of allah without an authority having come to them great is hatred of them in the sight of allah and in the sight of those who have believed thus does allah seal over every heart belonging to an arrogant tyrant
40|36|and pharaoh said o haman construct for me a tower that i might reach the ways
40|37|the ways into the heavens so that i may look at the deity of moses but indeed i think he is a liar and thus was made attractive to pharaoh the evil of his deed and he was averted from the right way and the plan of pharaoh was not except in ruin
40|38|and he who believed said o my people follow me i will guide you to the way of right conduct
40|39|o my people this worldly life is only temporary enjoyment and indeed the hereafter that is the home of permanent settlement
40|40|whoever does an evil deed will not be recompensed except by the like thereof but whoever does righteousness whether male or female while he is a believer those will enter paradise being given provision therein without account
40|41|and o my people how is it that i invite you to salvation while you invite me to the fire
40|42|you invite me to disbelieve in allah and associate with him that of which i have no knowledge and i invite you to the exalted in might the perpetual forgiver
40|43|assuredly that to which you invite me has no response to a supplication in this world or in the hereafter and indeed our return is to allah and indeed the transgressors will be companions of the fire
40|44|and you will remember what i now say to you and i entrust my affair to allah indeed allah is seeing of his servants
40|45|so allah protected him from the evils they plotted and the people of pharaoh were enveloped by the worst of punishment
40|46|the fire they are exposed to it morning and evening and the day the hour appears it will be said make the people of pharaoh enter the severest punishment
40|47|and mention when they will argue within the fire and the weak will say to those who had been arrogant indeed we were only your followers so will you relieve us of a share of the fire
40|48|those who had been arrogant will say indeed all of us are in it indeed allah has judged between the servants
40|49|and those in the fire will say to the keepers of hell supplicate your lord to lighten for us a day from the punishment
40|50|they will say did there not come to you your messengers with clear proofs they will say yes they will reply then supplicate yourselves but the supplication of the disbelievers is not except in error
40|51|indeed we will support our messengers and those who believe during the life of this world and on the day when the witnesses will stand
40|52|the day their excuse will not benefit the wrongdoers and they will have the curse and they will have the worst home
40|53|and we had certainly given moses guidance and we caused the children of israel to inherit the scripture
40|54|as guidance and a reminder for those of understanding
40|55|so be patient o muhammad indeed the promise of allah is truth and ask forgiveness for your sin and exalt allah with praise of your lord in the evening and the morning
40|56|indeed those who dispute concerning the signs of allah without any authority having come to them there is not within their breasts except pride the extent of which they cannot reach so seek refuge in allah indeed it is he who is the hearing the seeing
40|57|the creation of the heavens and earth is greater than the creation of mankind but most of the people do not know
40|58|and not equal are the blind and the seeing nor are those who believe and do righteous deeds and the evildoer little do you remember
40|59|indeed the hour is coming no doubt about it but most of the people do not believe
40|60|and your lord says call upon me i will respond to you indeed those who disdain my worship will enter hell rendered contemptible
40|61|it is allah who made for you the night that you may rest therein and the day giving sight indeed allah is full of bounty to the people but most of the people are not grateful
40|62|that is allah your lord creator of all things there is no deity except him so how are you deluded
40|63|thus were those before you deluded who were rejecting the signs of allah
40|64|it is allah who made for you the earth a place of settlement and the sky a ceiling and formed you and perfected your forms and provided you with good things that is allah your lord then blessed is allah lord of the worlds
40|65|he is the ever living there is no deity except him so call upon him being sincere to him in religion all praise is due to allah lord of the worlds
40|66|say o muhammad indeed i have been forbidden to worship those you call upon besides allah once the clear proofs have come to me from my lord and i have been commanded to submit to the lord of the worlds
40|67|it is he who created you from dust then from a sperm drop then from a clinging clot then he brings you out as a child then he develops you that you reach your time of maturity then further that you become elders and among you is he who is taken in death before that so that you reach a specified term and perhaps you will use reason
40|68|he it is who gives life and causes death and when he decrees a matter he but says to it be and it is
40|69|do you not consider those who dispute concerning the signs of allah how are they averted
40|70|those who deny the book and that with which we sent our messengers they are going to know
40|71|when the shackles are around their necks and the chains they will be dragged
40|72|in boiling water then in the fire they will be filled with flame
40|73|then it will be said to them where is that which you used to associate with him in worship
40|74|other than allah they will say they have departed from us rather we did not used to invoke previously anything thus does allah put astray the disbelievers
40|75|the angels will say that was because you used to exult upon the earth without right and you used to behave insolently
40|76|enter the gates of hell to abide eternally therein and wretched is the residence of the arrogant
40|77|so be patient o muhammad indeed the promise of allah is truth and whether we show you some of what we have promised them or we take you in death it is to us they will be returned
40|78|and we have already sent messengers before you among them are those whose stories we have related to you and among them are those whose stories we have not related to you and it was not for any messenger to bring a sign or verse except by permission of allah so when the command of allah comes it will be concluded in truth and the falsifiers will thereupon lose all
40|79|it is allah who made for you the grazing animals upon which you ride and some of them you eat
40|80|and for you therein are other benefits and that you may realize upon them a need which is in your breasts and upon them and upon ships you are carried
40|81|and he shows you his signs so which of the signs of allah do you deny
40|82|have they not traveled through the land and observed how was the end of those before them they were more numerous than themselves and greater in strength and in impression on the land but they were not availed by what they used to earn
40|83|and when their messengers came to them with clear proofs they merely rejoiced in what they had of knowledge but they were enveloped by what they used to ridicule
40|84|and when they saw our punishment they said we believe in allah alone and disbelieve in that which we used to associate with him
40|85|but never did their faith benefit them once they saw our punishment it is the established way of allah which has preceded among his servants and the disbelievers thereupon lost all
41|1|ha meem
41|2|this is a revelation from the entirely merciful the especially merciful
41|3|a book whose verses have been detailed an arabic qur an for a people who know
41|4|as a giver of good tidings and a warner but most of them turn away so they do not hear
41|5|and they say our hearts are within coverings from that to which you invite us and in our ears is deafness and between us and you is a partition so work indeed we are working
41|6|say o muhammad i am only a man like you to whom it has been revealed that your god is but one god so take a straight course to him and seek his forgiveness and woe to those who associate others with allah
41|7|those who do not give zakah and in the hereafter they are disbelievers
41|8|indeed those who believe and do righteous deeds for them is a reward uninterrupted
41|9|say do you indeed disbelieve in he who created the earth in two days and attribute to him equals that is the lord of the worlds
41|10|and he placed on the earth firmly set mountains over its surface and he blessed it and determined therein its creatures sustenance in four days without distinction for the information of those who ask
41|11|then he directed himself to the heaven while it was smoke and said to it and to the earth come into being willingly or by compulsion they said we have come willingly
41|12|and he completed them as seven heavens within two days and inspired in each heaven its command and we adorned the nearest heaven with lamps and as protection that is the determination of the exalted in might the knowing
41|13|but if they turn away then say i have warned you of a thunderbolt like the thunderbolt that struck aad and thamud
41|14|that occurred when the messengers had come to them before them and after them saying worship not except allah they said if our lord had willed he would have sent down the angels so indeed we in that with which you have been sent are disbelievers
41|15|as for aad they were arrogant upon the earth without right and said who is greater than us in strength did they not consider that allah who created them was greater than them in strength but they were rejecting our signs
41|16|so we sent upon them a screaming wind during days of misfortune to make them taste the punishment of disgrace in the worldly life but the punishment of the hereafter is more disgracing and they will not be helped
41|17|and as for thamud we guided them but they preferred blindness over guidance so the thunderbolt of humiliating punishment seized them for what they used to earn
41|18|and we saved those who believed and used to fear allah
41|19|and mention o muhammad the day when the enemies of allah will be gathered to the fire while they are driven assembled in rows
41|20|until when they reach it their hearing and their eyes and their skins will testify against them of what they used to do
41|21|and they will say to their skins why have you testified against us they will say we were made to speak by allah who has made everything speak and he created you the first time and to him you are returned
41|22|and you were not covering yourselves lest your hearing testify against you or your sight or your skins but you assumed that allah does not know much of what you do
41|23|and that was your assumption which you assumed about your lord it has brought you to ruin and you have become among the losers
41|24|so even if they are patient the fire is a residence for them and if they ask to appease allah they will not be of those who are allowed to appease
41|25|and we appointed for them companions who made attractive to them what was before them and what was behind them of sin and the word has come into effect upon them among nations which had passed on before them of jinn and men indeed they all were losers
41|26|and those who disbelieve say do not listen to this qur an and speak noisily during the recitation of it that perhaps you will overcome
41|27|but we will surely cause those who disbelieve to taste a severe punishment and we will surely recompense them for the worst of what they had been doing
41|28|that is the recompense of the enemies of allah the fire for them therein is the home of eternity as recompense for what they of our verses were rejecting
41|29|and those who disbelieved will then say our lord show us those who misled us of the jinn and men so we may put them under our feet that they will be among the lowest
41|30|indeed those who have said our lord is allah and then remained on a right course the angels will descend upon them saying do not fear and do not grieve but receive good tidings of paradise which you were promised
41|31|we angels were your allies in worldly life and are so in the hereafter and you will have therein whatever your souls desire and you will have therein whatever you request or wish
41|32|as accommodation from a lord who is forgiving and merciful
41|33|and who is better in speech than one who invites to allah and does righteousness and says indeed i am of the muslims
41|34|and not equal are the good deed and the bad repel evil by that deed which is better and thereupon the one whom between you and him is enmity will become as though he was a devoted friend
41|35|but none is granted it except those who are patient and none is granted it except one having a great portion of good
41|36|and if there comes to you from satan an evil suggestion then seek refuge in allah indeed he is the hearing the knowing
41|37|and of his signs are the night and day and the sun and moon do not prostrate to the sun or to the moon but prostate to allah who created them if it should be him that you worship
41|38|but if they are arrogant then those who are near your lord exalt him by night and by day and they do not become weary
41|39|and of his signs is that you see the earth stilled but when we send down upon it rain it quivers and grows indeed he who has given it life is the giver of life to the dead indeed he is over all things competent
41|40|indeed those who inject deviation into our verses are not concealed from us so is he who is cast into the fire better or he who comes secure on the day of resurrection do whatever you will indeed he is seeing of what you do
41|41|indeed those who disbelieve in the message after it has come to them and indeed it is a mighty book
41|42|falsehood cannot approach it from before it or from behind it it is a revelation from a lord who is wise and praiseworthy
41|43|nothing is said to you o muhammad except what was already said to the messengers before you indeed your lord is a possessor of forgiveness and a possessor of painful penalty
41|44|and if we had made it a non arabic qur an they would have said why are its verses not explained in detail in our language is it a foreign recitation and an arab messenger say it is for those who believe a guidance and cure and those who do not believe in their ears is deafness and it is upon them blindness those are being called from a distant place
41|45|and we had already given moses the scripture but it came under disagreement and if not for a word that preceded from your lord it would have been concluded between them and indeed they are concerning the qur an in disquieting doubt
41|46|whoever does righteousness it is for his own soul and whoever does evil does so against it and your lord is not ever unjust to his servants
41|47|to him alone is attributed knowledge of the hour and fruits emerge not from their coverings nor does a female conceive or give birth except with his knowledge and the day he will call to them where are my partners they will say we announce to you that there is no longer among us any witness to that
41|48|and lost from them will be those they were invoking before and they will be certain that they have no place of escape
41|49|man is not weary of supplication for good things but if evil touches him he is hopeless and despairing
41|50|and if we let him taste mercy from us after an adversity which has touched him he will surely say this is due to me and i do not think the hour will occur and even if i should be returned to my lord indeed for me there will be with him the best but we will surely inform those who disbelieved about what they did and we will surely make them taste a massive punishment
41|51|and when we bestow favor upon man he turns away and distances himself but when evil touches him then he is full of extensive supplication
41|52|say have you considered if the qur an is from allah and you disbelieved in it who would be more astray than one who is in extreme dissension
41|53|we will show them our signs in the horizons and within themselves until it becomes clear to them that it is the truth but is it not sufficient concerning your lord that he is over all things a witness
41|54|unquestionably they are in doubt about the meeting with their lord unquestionably he is of all things encompassing
42|1|ha meem
42|2|ayn seen qaf
42|3|thus has he revealed to you o muhammad and to those before you allah the exalted in might the wise
42|4|to him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth and he is the most high the most great
42|5|the heavens almost break from above them and the angels exalt allah with praise of their lord and ask forgiveness for those on earth unquestionably it is allah who is the forgiving the merciful
42|6|and those who take as allies other than him allah is yet guardian over them and you o muhammad are not over them a manager
42|7|and thus we have revealed to you an arabic qur an that you may warn the mother of cities makkah and those around it and warn of the day of assembly about which there is no doubt a party will be in paradise and a party in the blaze
42|8|and if allah willed he could have made them of one religion but he admits whom he wills into his mercy and the wrongdoers have not any protector or helper
42|9|or have they taken protectors or allies besides him but allah he is the protector and he gives life to the dead and he is over all things competent
42|10|and in anything over which you disagree its ruling is to be referred to allah say that is allah my lord upon him i have relied and to him i turn back
42|11|he is creator of the heavens and the earth he has made for you from yourselves mates and among the cattle mates he multiplies you thereby there is nothing like unto him and he is the hearing the seeing
42|12|to him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth he extends provision for whom he wills and restricts it indeed he is of all things knowing
42|13|he has ordained for you of religion what he enjoined upon noah and that which we have revealed to you o muhammad and what we enjoined upon abraham and moses and jesus to establish the religion and not be divided therein difficult for those who associate others with allah is that to which you invite them allah chooses for himself whom he wills and guides to himself whoever turns back to him
42|14|and they did not become divided until after knowledge had come to them out of jealous animosity between themselves and if not for a word that preceded from your lord postponing the penalty until a specified time it would have been concluded between them and indeed those who were granted inheritance of the scripture after them are concerning it in disquieting doubt
42|15|so to that religion of allah invite o muhammad and remain on a right course as you are commanded and do not follow their inclinations but say i have believed in what allah has revealed of the qur an and i have been commanded to do justice among you allah is our lord and your lord for us are our deeds and for you your deeds there is no need for argument between us and you allah will bring us together and to him is the final destination
42|16|and those who argue concerning allah after he has been responded to their argument is invalid with their lord and upon them is his wrath and for them is a severe punishment
42|17|it is allah who has sent down the book in truth and also the balance and what will make you perceive perhaps the hour is near
42|18|those who do not believe in it are impatient for it but those who believe are fearful of it and know that it is the truth unquestionably those who dispute concerning the hour are in extreme error
42|19|allah is subtle with his servants he gives provisions to whom he wills and he is the powerful the exalted in might
42|20|whoever desires the harvest of the hereafter we increase for him in his harvest and whoever desires the harvest of this world we give him thereof but there is not for him in the hereafter any share
42|21|or have they other deities who have ordained for them a religion to which allah has not consented but if not for the decisive word it would have been concluded between them and indeed the wrongdoers will have a painful punishment
42|22|you will see the wrongdoers fearful of what they have earned and it will certainly befall them and those who have believed and done righteous deeds will be in lush regions of the gardens in paradise having whatever they will in the presence of their lord that is what is the great bounty
42|23|it is that of which allah gives good tidings to his servants who believe and do righteous deeds say o muhammad i do not ask you for this message any payment but only good will through kinship and whoever commits a good deed we will increase for him good therein indeed allah is forgiving and appreciative
42|24|or do they say he has invented about allah a lie but if allah willed he could seal over your heart and allah eliminates falsehood and establishes the truth by his words indeed he is knowing of that within the breasts
42|25|and it is he who accepts repentance from his servants and pardons misdeeds and he knows what you do
42|26|and he answers the supplication of those who have believed and done righteous deeds and increases for them from his bounty but the disbelievers will have a severe punishment
42|27|and if allah had extended excessively provision for his servants they would have committed tyranny throughout the earth but he sends it down in an amount which he wills indeed he is of his servants acquainted and seeing
42|28|and it is he who sends down the rain after they had despaired and spreads his mercy and he is the protector the praiseworthy
42|29|and of his signs is the creation of the heavens and earth and what he has dispersed throughout them of creatures and he for gathering them when he wills is competent
42|30|and whatever strikes you of disaster it is for what your hands have earned but he pardons much
42|31|and you will not cause failure to allah upon the earth and you have not besides allah any protector or helper
42|32|and of his signs are the ships in the sea like mountains
42|33|if he willed he could still the wind and they would remain motionless on its surface indeed in that are signs for everyone patient and grateful
42|34|or he could destroy them for what they earned but he pardons much
42|35|and that is so those who dispute concerning our signs may know that for them there is no place of escape
42|36|so whatever thing you have been given it is but for enjoyment of the worldly life but what is with allah is better and more lasting for those who have believed and upon their lord rely
42|37|and those who avoid the major sins and immoralities and when they are angry they forgive
42|38|and those who have responded to their lord and established prayer and whose affair is determined by consultation among themselves and from what we have provided them they spend
42|39|and those who when tyranny strikes them they defend themselves
42|40|and the retribution for an evil act is an evil one like it but whoever pardons and makes reconciliation his reward is due from allah indeed he does not like wrongdoers
42|41|and whoever avenges himself after having been wronged those have not upon them any cause for blame
42|42|the cause is only against the ones who wrong the people and tyrannize upon the earth without right those will have a painful punishment
42|43|and whoever is patient and forgives indeed that is of the matters requiring determination
42|44|and he whom allah sends astray for him there is no protector beyond him and you will see the wrongdoers when they see the punishment saying is there for return to the former world any way
42|45|and you will see them being exposed to the fire humbled from humiliation looking from behind a covert glance and those who had believed will say indeed the true losers are the ones who lost themselves and their families on the day of resurrection unquestionably the wrongdoers are in an enduring punishment
42|46|and there will not be for them any allies to aid them other than allah and whoever allah sends astray for him there is no way
42|47|respond to your lord before a day comes from allah of which there is no repelling no refuge will you have that day nor for you will there be any denial
42|48|but if they turn away then we have not sent you o muhammad over them as a guardian upon you is only the duty of notification and indeed when we let man taste mercy from us he rejoices in it but if evil afflicts him for what his hands have put forth then indeed man is ungrateful
42|49|to allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth he creates what he wills he gives to whom he wills female children and he gives to whom he wills males
42|50|or he makes them both males and females and he renders whom he wills barren indeed he is knowing and competent
42|51|and it is not for any human being that allah should speak to him except by revelation or from behind a partition or that he sends a messenger to reveal by his permission what he wills indeed he is most high and wise
42|52|and thus we have revealed to you an inspiration of our command you did not know what is the book or what is faith but we have made it a light by which we guide whom we will of our servants and indeed o muhammad you guide to a straight path
42|53|the path of allah to whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth unquestionably to allah do all matters evolve
43|1|ha meem
43|2|by the clear book
43|3|indeed we have made it an arabic qur an that you might understand
43|4|and indeed it is in the mother of the book with us exalted and full of wisdom
43|5|then should we turn the message away disregarding you because you are a transgressing people
43|6|and how many a prophet we sent among the former peoples
43|7|but there would not come to them a prophet except that they used to ridicule him
43|8|and we destroyed greater than them in striking power and the example of the former peoples has preceded
43|9|and if you should ask them who has created the heavens and the earth they would surely say they were created by the exalted in might the knowing
43|10|the one who has made for you the earth a bed and made for you upon it roads that you might be guided
43|11|and who sends down rain from the sky in measured amounts and we revive thereby a dead land thus will you be brought forth
43|12|and who created the species all of them and has made for you of ships and animals those which you mount
43|13|that you may settle yourselves upon their backs and then remember the favor of your lord when you have settled upon them and say exalted is he who has subjected this to us and we could not have otherwise subdued it
43|14|and indeed we to our lord will surely return
43|15|but they have attributed to him from his servants a portion indeed man is clearly ungrateful
43|16|or has he taken out of what he has created daughters and chosen you for having sons
43|17|and when one of them is given good tidings of that which he attributes to the most merciful in comparison his face becomes dark and he suppresses grief
43|18|so is one brought up in ornaments while being during conflict unevident attributed to allah
43|19|and they have made the angels who are servants of the most merciful females did they witness their creation their testimony will be recorded and they will be questioned
43|20|and they said if the most merciful had willed we would not have worshipped them they have of that no knowledge they are not but falsifying
43|21|or have we given them a book before the qur an to which they are adhering
43|22|rather they say indeed we found our fathers upon a religion and we are in their footsteps rightly guided
43|23|and similarly we did not send before you any warner into a city except that its affluent said indeed we found our fathers upon a religion and we are in their footsteps following
43|24|each warner said even if i brought you better guidance than that religion upon which you found your fathers they said indeed we in that with which you were sent are disbelievers
43|25|so we took retribution from them then see how was the end of the deniers
43|26|and mention o muhammad when abraham said to his father and his people indeed i am disassociated from that which you worship
43|27|except for he who created me and indeed he will guide me
43|28|and he made it a word remaining among his descendants that they might return to it
43|29|however i gave enjoyment to these people of makkah and their fathers until there came to them the truth and a clear messenger
43|30|but when the truth came to them they said this is magic and indeed we are concerning it disbelievers
43|31|and they said why was this qur an not sent down upon a great man from one of the two cities
43|32|do they distribute the mercy of your lord it is we who have apportioned among them their livelihood in the life of this world and have raised some of them above others in degrees of rank that they may make use of one another for service but the mercy of your lord is better than whatever they accumulate
43|33|and if it were not that the people would become one community of disbelievers we would have made for those who disbelieve in the most merciful for their houses ceilings and stairways of silver upon which to mount
43|34|and for their houses doors and couches of silver upon which to recline
43|35|and gold ornament but all that is not but the enjoyment of worldly life and the hereafter with your lord is for the righteous
43|36|and whoever is blinded from remembrance of the most merciful we appoint for him a devil and he is to him a companion
43|37|and indeed the devils avert them from the way of guidance while they think that they are rightly guided
43|38|until when he comes to us at judgement he says to his companion oh i wish there was between me and you the distance between the east and west how wretched a companion
43|39|and never will it benefit you that day when you have wronged that you are all sharing in the punishment
43|40|then will you make the deaf hear o muhammad or guide the blind or he who is in clear error
43|41|and whether or not we take you away in death indeed we will take retribution upon them
43|42|or whether or not we show you that which we have promised them indeed we are perfect in ability
43|43|so adhere to that which is revealed to you indeed you are on a straight path
43|44|and indeed it is a remembrance for you and your people and you all are going to be questioned
43|45|and ask those we sent before you of our messengers have we made besides the most merciful deities to be worshipped
43|46|and certainly did we send moses with our signs to pharaoh and his establishment and he said indeed i am the messenger of the lord of the worlds
43|47|but when he brought them our signs at once they laughed at them
43|48|and we showed them not a sign except that it was greater than its sister and we seized them with affliction that perhaps they might return to faith
43|49|and they said to moses o magician invoke for us your lord by what he has promised you indeed we will be guided
43|50|but when we removed from them the affliction at once they broke their word
43|51|and pharaoh called out among his people he said o my people does not the kingdom of egypt belong to me and these rivers flowing beneath me then do you not see
43|52|or am i not better than this one who is insignificant and hardly makes himself clear
43|53|then why have there not been placed upon him bracelets of gold or come with him the angels in conjunction
43|54|so he bluffed his people and they obeyed him indeed they were themselves a people defiantly disobedient of allah
43|55|and when they angered us we took retribution from them and drowned them all
43|56|and we made them a precedent and an example for the later peoples
43|57|and when the son of mary was presented as an example immediately your people laughed aloud
43|58|and they said are your gods better or is he they did not present the comparison except for mere argument but in fact they are a people prone to dispute
43|59|jesus was not but a servant upon whom we bestowed favor and we made him an example for the children of israel
43|60|and if we willed we could have made instead of you angels succeeding one another on the earth
43|61|and indeed jesus will be a sign for knowledge of the hour so be not in doubt of it and follow me this is a straight path
43|62|and never let satan avert you indeed he is to you a clear enemy
43|63|and when jesus brought clear proofs he said i have come to you with wisdom and to make clear to you some of that over which you differ so fear allah and obey me
43|64|indeed allah is my lord and your lord so worship him this is a straight path
43|65|but the denominations from among them differed and separated so woe to those who have wronged from the punishment of a painful day
43|66|are they waiting except for the hour to come upon them suddenly while they perceive not
43|67|close friends that day will be enemies to each other except for the righteous
43|68|to whom allah will say o my servants no fear will there be concerning you this day nor will you grieve
43|69|you who believed in our verses and were muslims
43|70|enter paradise you and your kinds delighted
43|71|circulated among them will be plates and vessels of gold and therein is whatever the souls desire and what delights the eyes and you will abide therein eternally
43|72|and that is paradise which you are made to inherit for what you used to do
43|73|for you therein is much fruit from which you will eat
43|74|indeed the criminals will be in the punishment of hell abiding eternally
43|75|it will not be allowed to subside for them and they therein are in despair
43|76|and we did not wrong them but it was they who were the wrongdoers
43|77|and they will call o malik let your lord put an end to us he will say indeed you will remain
43|78|we had certainly brought you the truth but most of you to the truth were averse
43|79|or have they devised some affair but indeed we are devising a plan
43|80|or do they think that we hear not their secrets and their private conversations yes we do and our messengers are with them recording
43|81|say o muhammad if the most merciful had a son then i would be the first of his worshippers
43|82|exalted is the lord of the heavens and the earth lord of the throne above what they describe
43|83|so leave them to converse vainly and amuse themselves until they meet their day which they are promised
43|84|and it is allah who is the only deity in the heaven and on the earth the only deity and he is the wise the knowing
43|85|and blessed is he to whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them and with whom is knowledge of the hour and to whom you will be returned
43|86|and those they invoke besides him do not possess power of intercession but only those who testify to the truth can benefit and they know
43|87|and if you asked them who created them they would surely say allah so how are they deluded
43|88|and allah acknowledges his saying o my lord indeed these are a people who do not believe
43|89|so turn aside from them and say peace but they are going to know
44|1|ha meem
44|2|by the clear book
44|3|indeed we sent it down during a blessed night indeed we were to warn mankind
44|4|on that night is made distinct every precise matter
44|5|every matter proceeding from us indeed we were to send a messenger
44|6|as mercy from your lord indeed he is the hearing the knowing
44|7|lord of the heavens and the earth and that between them if you would be certain
44|8|there is no deity except him he gives life and causes death he is your lord and the lord of your first forefathers
44|9|but they are in doubt amusing themselves
44|10|then watch for the day when the sky will bring a visible smoke
44|11|covering the people this is a painful torment
44|12|they will say our lord remove from us the torment indeed we are believers
44|13|how will there be for them a reminder at that time and there had come to them a clear messenger
44|14|then they turned away from him and said he was taught and is a madman
44|15|indeed we will remove the torment for a little indeed you disbelievers will return to disbelief
44|16|the day we will strike with the greatest assault indeed we will take retribution
44|17|and we had already tried before them the people of pharaoh and there came to them a noble messenger
44|18|saying render to me the servants of allah indeed i am to you a trustworthy messenger
44|19|and saying be not haughty with allah indeed i have come to you with clear authority
44|20|and indeed i have sought refuge in my lord and your lord lest you stone me
44|21|but if you do not believe me then leave me alone
44|22|and finally he called to his lord that these were a criminal people
44|23|allah said then set out with my servants by night indeed you are to be pursued
44|24|and leave the sea in stillness indeed they are an army to be drowned
44|25|how much they left behind of gardens and springs
44|26|and crops and noble sites
44|27|and comfort wherein they were amused
44|28|thus and we caused to inherit it another people
44|29|and the heaven and earth wept not for them nor were they reprieved
44|30|and we certainly saved the children of israel from the humiliating torment
44|31|from pharaoh indeed he was a haughty one among the transgressors
44|32|and we certainly chose them by knowledge over all the worlds
44|33|and we gave them of signs that in which there was a clear trial
44|34|indeed these disbelievers are saying
44|35|there is not but our first death and we will not be resurrected
44|36|then bring back our forefathers if you should be truthful
44|37|are they better or the people of tubba and those before them we destroyed them for indeed they were criminals
44|38|and we did not create the heavens and earth and that between them in play
44|39|we did not create them except in truth but most of them do not know
44|40|indeed the day of judgement is the appointed time for them all
44|41|the day when no relation will avail a relation at all nor will they be helped
44|42|except those believers on whom allah has mercy indeed he is the exalted in might the merciful
44|43|indeed the tree of zaqqum
44|44|is food for the sinful
44|45|like murky oil it boils within bellies
44|46|like the boiling of scalding water
44|47|it will be commanded seize him and drag him into the midst of the hellfire
44|48|then pour over his head from the torment of scalding water
44|49|it will be said taste indeed you are the honored the noble
44|50|indeed this is what you used to dispute
44|51|indeed the righteous will be in a secure place
44|52|within gardens and springs
44|53|wearing garments of fine silk and brocade facing each other
44|54|thus and we will marry them to fair women with large beautiful eyes
44|55|they will call therein for every kind of fruit safe and secure
44|56|they will not taste death therein except the first death and he will have protected them from the punishment of hellfire
44|57|as bounty from your lord that is what is the great attainment
44|58|and indeed we have eased the qur an in your tongue that they might be reminded
44|59|so watch o muhammad indeed they are watching for your end
45|1|ha meem
45|2|the revelation of the book is from allah the exalted in might the wise
45|3|indeed within the heavens and earth are signs for the believers
45|4|and in the creation of yourselves and what he disperses of moving creatures are signs for people who are certain in faith
45|5|and in the alternation of night and day and in what allah sends down from the sky of provision and gives life thereby to the earth after its lifelessness and in his directing of the winds are signs for a people who reason
45|6|these are the verses of allah which we recite to you in truth then in what statement after allah and his verses will they believe
45|7|woe to every sinful liar
45|8|who hears the verses of allah recited to him then persists arrogantly as if he had not heard them so give him tidings of a painful punishment
45|9|and when he knows anything of our verses he takes them in ridicule those will have a humiliating punishment
45|10|before them is hell and what they had earned will not avail them at all nor what they had taken besides allah as allies and they will have a great punishment
45|11|this qur an is guidance and those who have disbelieved in the verses of their lord will have a painful punishment of foul nature
45|12|it is allah who subjected to you the sea so that ships may sail upon it by his command and that you may seek of his bounty and perhaps you will be grateful
45|13|and he has subjected to you whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth all from him indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought
45|14|say o muhammad to those who have believed that they should forgive those who expect not the days of allah so that he may recompense a people for what they used to earn
45|15|whoever does a good deed it is for himself and whoever does evil it is against the self then to your lord you will be returned
45|16|and we did certainly give the children of israel the scripture and judgement and prophethood and we provided them with good things and preferred them over the worlds
45|17|and we gave them clear proofs of the matter of religion and they did not differ except after knowledge had come to them out of jealous animosity between themselves indeed your lord will judge between them on the day of resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ
45|18|then we put you o muhammad on an ordained way concerning the matter of religion so follow it and do not follow the inclinations of those who do not know
45|19|indeed they will never avail you against allah at all and indeed the wrongdoers are allies of one another but allah is the protector of the righteous
45|20|this qur an is enlightenment for mankind and guidance and mercy for a people who are certain in faith
45|21|or do those who commit evils think we will make them like those who have believed and done righteous deeds make them equal in their life and their death evil is that which they judge
45|22|and allah created the heavens and earth in truth and so that every soul may be recompensed for what it has earned and they will not be wronged
45|23|have you seen he who has taken as his god his own desire and allah has sent him astray due to knowledge and has set a seal upon his hearing and his heart and put over his vision a veil so who will guide him after allah then will you not be reminded
45|24|and they say there is not but our worldly life we die and live and nothing destroys us except time and they have of that no knowledge they are only assuming
45|25|and when our verses are recited to them as clear evidences their argument is only that they say bring back our forefathers if you should be truthful
45|26|say allah causes you to live then causes you to die then he will assemble you for the day of resurrection about which there is no doubt but most of the people do not know
45|27|and to allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and the day the hour appears that day the falsifiers will lose
45|28|and you will see every nation kneeling from fear every nation will be called to its record and told today you will be recompensed for what you used to do
45|29|this our record speaks about you in truth indeed we were having transcribed whatever you used to do
45|30|so as for those who believed and did righteous deeds their lord will admit them into his mercy that is what is the clear attainment
45|31|but as for those who disbelieved it will be said were not our verses recited to you but you were arrogant and became a people of criminals
45|32|and when it was said indeed the promise of allah is truth and the hour is coming no doubt about it you said we know not what is the hour we assume only assumption and we are not convinced
45|33|and the evil consequences of what they did will appear to them and they will be enveloped by what they used to ridicule
45|34|and it will be said today we will forget you as you forgot the meeting of this day of yours and your refuge is the fire and for you there are no helpers
45|35|that is because you took the verses of allah in ridicule and worldly life deluded you so that day they will not be removed from it nor will they be asked to appease allah
45|36|then to allah belongs all praise lord of the heavens and lord of the earth lord of the worlds
45|37|and to him belongs all grandeur within the heavens and the earth and he is the exalted in might the wise
46|1|ha meem
46|2|the revelation of the book is from allah the exalted in might the wise
46|3|we did not create the heavens and earth and what is between them except in truth and for a specified term but those who disbelieve from that of which they are warned are turning away
46|4|say o muhammad have you considered that which you invoke besides allah show me what they have created of the earth or did they have partnership in creation of the heavens bring me a scripture revealed before this or a remaining trace of knowledge if you should be truthful
46|5|and who is more astray than he who invokes besides allah those who will not respond to him until the day of resurrection and they of their invocation are unaware
46|6|and when the people are gathered that day they who were invoked will be enemies to them and they will be deniers of their worship
46|7|and when our verses are recited to them as clear evidences those who disbelieve say of the truth when it has come to them this is obvious magic
46|8|or do they say he has invented it say if i have invented it you will not possess for me the power of protection from allah at all he is most knowing of that in which you are involved sufficient is he as witness between me and you and he is the forgiving the merciful
46|9|say i am not something original among the messengers nor do i know what will be done with me or with you i only follow that which is revealed to me and i am not but a clear warner
46|10|say have you considered if the qur an was from allah and you disbelieved in it while a witness from the children of israel has testified to something similar and believed while you were arrogant indeed allah does not guide the wrongdoing people
46|11|and those who disbelieve say of those who believe if it had truly been good they would not have preceded us to it and when they are not guided by it they will say this is an ancient falsehood
46|12|and before it was the scripture of moses to lead and as a mercy and this is a confirming book in an arabic tongue to warn those who have wronged and as good tidings to the doers of good
46|13|indeed those who have said our lord is allah and then remained on a right course there will be no fear concerning them nor will they grieve
46|14|those are the companions of paradise abiding eternally therein as reward for what they used to do
46|15|and we have enjoined upon man to his parents good treatment his mother carried him with hardship and gave birth to him with hardship and his gestation and weaning period is thirty months he grows until when he reaches maturity and reaches the age of forty years he says my lord enable me to be grateful for your favor which you have bestowed upon me and upon my parents and to work righteousness of which you will approve and make righteous for me my offspring indeed i have repented to you and indeed i am of the muslims
46|16|those are the ones from whom we will accept the best of what they did and overlook their misdeeds their being among the companions of paradise that is the promise of truth which they had been promised
46|17|but one who says to his parents uff to you do you promise me that i will be brought forth from the earth when generations before me have already passed on into oblivion while they call to allah for help and to their son woe to you believe indeed the promise of allah is truth but he says this is not but legends of the former people
46|18|those are the ones upon whom the word has come into effect who will be among nations which had passed on before them of jinn and men indeed they all were losers
46|19|and for all there are degrees of reward and punishment for what they have done and it is so that he may fully compensate them for their deeds and they will not be wronged
46|20|and the day those who disbelieved are exposed to the fire it will be said you exhausted your pleasures during your worldly life and enjoyed them so this day you will be awarded the punishment of extreme humiliation because you were arrogant upon the earth without right and because you were defiantly disobedient
46|21|and mention o muhammad the brother of aad when he warned his people in the region of al ahqaf and warners had already passed on before him and after him saying do not worship except allah indeed i fear for you the punishment of a terrible day
46|22|they said have you come to delude us away from our gods then bring us what you promise us if you should be of the truthful
46|23|he said knowledge of its time is only with allah and i convey to you that with which i was sent but i see you to be a people behaving ignorantly
46|24|and when they saw it as a cloud approaching their valleys they said this is a cloud bringing us rain rather it is that for which you were impatient a wind within it a painful punishment
46|25|destroying everything by command of its lord and they became so that nothing was seen of them except their dwellings thus do we recompense the criminal people
46|26|and we had certainly established them in such as we have not established you and we made for them hearing and vision and hearts but their hearing and vision and hearts availed them not from anything of the punishment when they were continually rejecting the signs of allah and they were enveloped by what they used to ridicule
46|27|and we have already destroyed what surrounds you of those cities and we have diversified the signs or verses that perhaps they might return from disbelief
46|28|then why did those they took besides allah as deities by which to approach him not aid them but they had strayed from them and that was their falsehood and what they were inventing
46|29|and mention o muhammad when we directed to you a few of the jinn listening to the qur an and when they attended it they said listen quietly and when it was concluded they went back to their people as warners
46|30|they said o our people indeed we have heard a recited book revealed after moses confirming what was before it which guides to the truth and to a straight path
46|31|o our people respond to the messenger of allah and believe in him allah will forgive for you your sins and protect you from a painful punishment
46|32|but he who does not respond to the caller of allah will not cause failure to him upon earth and he will not have besides him any protectors those are in manifest error
46|33|do they not see that allah who created the heavens and earth and did not fail in their creation is able to give life to the dead yes indeed he is over all things competent
46|34|and the day those who disbelieved are exposed to the fire it will be said is this not the truth they will say yes by our lord he will say then taste the punishment because you used to disbelieve
46|35|so be patient o muhammad as were those of determination among the messengers and do not be impatient for them it will be on the day they see that which they are promised as though they had not remained in the world except an hour of a day this is notification and will any be destroyed except the defiantly disobedient people
47|1|those who disbelieve and avert people from the way of allah he will waste their deeds
47|2|and those who believe and do righteous deeds and believe in what has been sent down upon muhammad and it is the truth from their lord he will remove from them their misdeeds and amend their condition
47|3|that is because those who disbelieve follow falsehood and those who believe follow the truth from their lord thus does allah present to the people their comparisons
47|4|so when you meet those who disbelieve in battle strike their necks until when you have inflicted slaughter upon them then secure their bonds and either confer favor afterwards or ransom them until the war lays down its burdens that is the command and if allah had willed he could have taken vengeance upon them himself but he ordered armed struggle to test some of you by means of others and those who are killed in the cause of allah never will he waste their deeds
47|5|he will guide them and amend their condition
47|6|and admit them to paradise which he has made known to them
47|7|o you who have believed if you support allah he will support you and plant firmly your feet
47|8|but those who disbelieve for them is misery and he will waste their deeds
47|9|that is because they disliked what allah revealed so he rendered worthless their deeds
47|10|have they not traveled through the land and seen how was the end of those before them allah destroyed everything over them and for the disbelievers is something comparable
47|11|that is because allah is the protector of those who have believed and because the disbelievers have no protector
47|12|indeed allah will admit those who have believed and done righteous deeds to gardens beneath which rivers flow but those who disbelieve enjoy themselves and eat as grazing livestock eat and the fire will be a residence for them
47|13|and how many a city was stronger than your city makkah which drove you out we destroyed them and there was no helper for them
47|14|so is he who is on clear evidence from his lord like him to whom the evil of his work has been made attractive and they follow their own desires
47|15|is the description of paradise which the righteous are promised wherein are rivers of water unaltered rivers of milk the taste of which never changes rivers of wine delicious to those who drink and rivers of purified honey in which they will have from all kinds of fruits and forgiveness from their lord like that of those who abide eternally in the fire and are given to drink scalding water that will sever their intestines
47|16|and among them o muhammad are those who listen to you until when they depart from you they say to those who were given knowledge what has he said just now those are the ones of whom allah has sealed over their hearts and who have followed their own desires
47|17|and those who are guided he increases them in guidance and gives them their righteousness
47|18|then do they await except that the hour should come upon them unexpectedly but already there have come some of its indications then what good to them when it has come will be their remembrance
47|19|so know o muhammad that there is no deity except allah and ask forgiveness for your sin and for the believing men and believing women and allah knows of your movement and your resting place
47|20|those who believe say why has a surah not been sent down but when a precise surah is revealed and fighting is mentioned therein you see those in whose hearts is hypocrisy looking at you with a look of one overcome by death and more appropriate for them would have been
47|21|obedience and good words and when the matter of fighting was determined if they had been true to allah it would have been better for them
47|22|so would you perhaps if you turned away cause corruption on earth and sever your ties of relationship
47|23|those who do so are the ones that allah has cursed so he deafened them and blinded their vision
47|24|then do they not reflect upon the qur an or are there locks upon their hearts
47|25|indeed those who reverted back to disbelief after guidance had become clear to them satan enticed them and prolonged hope for them
47|26|that is because they said to those who disliked what allah sent down we will obey you in part of the matter and allah knows what they conceal
47|27|then how will it be when the angels take them in death striking their faces and their backs
47|28|that is because they followed what angered allah and disliked what earns his pleasure so he rendered worthless their deeds
47|29|or do those in whose hearts is disease think that allah would never expose their feelings of hatred
47|30|and if we willed we could show them to you and you would know them by their mark but you will surely know them by the tone of their speech and allah knows your deeds
47|31|and we will surely test you until we make evident those who strive among you for the cause of allah and the patient and we will test your affairs
47|32|indeed those who disbelieved and averted people from the path of allah and opposed the messenger after guidance had become clear to them never will they harm allah at all and he will render worthless their deeds
47|33|o you who have believed obey allah and obey the messenger and do not invalidate your deeds
47|34|indeed those who disbelieved and averted people from the path of allah and then died while they were disbelievers never will allah forgive them
47|35|so do not weaken and call for peace while you are superior and allah is with you and will never deprive you of the reward of your deeds
47|36|this worldly life is only amusement and diversion and if you believe and fear allah he will give you your rewards and not ask you for your properties
47|37|if he should ask you for them and press you you would withhold and he would expose your unwillingness
47|38|here you are those invited to spend in the cause of allah but among you are those who withhold out of greed and whoever withholds only withholds benefit from himself and allah is the free of need while you are the needy and if you turn away he will replace you with another people then they will not be the likes of you
48|1|indeed we have given you o muhammad a clear conquest
48|2|that allah may forgive for you what preceded of your sin and what will follow and complete his favor upon you and guide you to a straight path
48|3|and that allah may aid you with a mighty victory
48|4|it is he who sent down tranquillity into the hearts of the believers that they would increase in faith along with their present faith and to allah belong the soldiers of the heavens and the earth and ever is allah knowing and wise
48|5|and that he may admit the believing men and the believing women to gardens beneath which rivers flow to abide therein eternally and remove from them their misdeeds and ever is that in the sight of allah a great attainment
48|6|and that he may punish the hypocrite men and hypocrite women and the polytheist men and polytheist women those who assume about allah an assumption of evil nature upon them is a misfortune of evil nature and allah has become angry with them and has cursed them and prepared for them hell and evil it is as a destination
48|7|and to allah belong the soldiers of the heavens and the earth and ever is allah exalted in might and wise
48|8|indeed we have sent you as a witness and a bringer of good tidings and a warner
48|9|that you people may believe in allah and his messenger and honor him and respect the prophet and exalt allah morning and afternoon
48|10|indeed those who pledge allegiance to you o muhammad they are actually pledging allegiance to allah the hand of allah is over their hands so he who breaks his word only breaks it to the detriment of himself and he who fulfills that which he has promised allah he will give him a great reward
48|11|those who remained behind of the bedouins will say to you our properties and our families occupied us so ask forgiveness for us they say with their tongues what is not within their hearts say then who could prevent allah at all if he intended for you harm or intended for you benefit rather ever is allah with what you do acquainted
48|12|but you thought that the messenger and the believers would never return to their families ever and that was made pleasing in your hearts and you assumed an assumption of evil and became a people ruined
48|13|and whoever has not believed in allah and his messenger then indeed we have prepared for the disbelievers a blaze
48|14|and to allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth he forgives whom he wills and punishes whom he wills and ever is allah forgiving and merciful
48|15|those who remained behind will say when you set out toward the war booty to take it let us follow you they wish to change the words of allah say never will you follow us thus did allah say before so they will say rather you envy us but in fact they were not understanding except a little
48|16|say to those who remained behind of the bedouins you will be called to face a people of great military might you may fight them or they will submit so if you obey allah will give you a good reward but if you turn away as you turned away before he will punish you with a painful punishment
48|17|there is not upon the blind any guilt or upon the lame any guilt or upon the ill any guilt for remaining behind and whoever obeys allah and his messenger he will admit him to gardens beneath which rivers flow but whoever turns away he will punish him with a painful punishment
48|18|certainly was allah pleased with the believers when they pledged allegiance to you o muhammad under the tree and he knew what was in their hearts so he sent down tranquillity upon them and rewarded them with an imminent conquest
48|19|and much war booty which they will take and ever is allah exalted in might and wise
48|20|allah has promised you much booty that you will take in the future and has hastened for you this victory and withheld the hands of people from you that it may be a sign for the believers and that he may guide you to a straight path
48|21|and he promises other victories that you were so far unable to realize which allah has already encompassed and ever is allah over all things competent
48|22|and if those makkans who disbelieve had fought you they would have turned their backs in flight then they would not find a protector or a helper
48|23|this is the established way of allah which has occurred before and never will you find in the way of allah any change
48|24|and it is he who withheld their hands from you and your hands from them within the area of makkah after he caused you to overcome them and ever is allah of what you do seeing
48|25|they are the ones who disbelieved and obstructed you from al masjid al haram while the offering was prevented from reaching its place of sacrifice and if not for believing men and believing women whom you did not know that you might trample them and there would befall you because of them dishonor without your knowledge you would have been permitted to enter makkah this was so that allah might admit to his mercy whom he willed if they had been apart from them we would have punished those who disbelieved among them with painful punishment
48|26|when those who disbelieved had put into their hearts chauvinism the chauvinism of the time of ignorance but allah sent down his tranquillity upon his messenger and upon the believers and imposed upon them the word of righteousness and they were more deserving of it and worthy of it and ever is allah of all things knowing
48|27|certainly has allah showed to his messenger the vision in truth you will surely enter al masjid al haram if allah wills in safety with your heads shaved and hair shortened not fearing anyone he knew what you did not know and has arranged before that a conquest near at hand
48|28|it is he who sent his messenger with guidance and the religion of truth to manifest it over all religion and sufficient is allah as witness
48|29|muhammad is the messenger of allah and those with him are forceful against the disbelievers merciful among themselves you see them bowing and prostrating in prayer seeking bounty from allah and his pleasure their mark is on their faces from the trace of prostration that is their description in the torah and their description in the gospel is as a plant which produces its offshoots and strengthens them so they grow firm and stand upon their stalks delighting the sowers so that allah may enrage by them the disbelievers allah has promised those who believe and do righteous deeds among them forgiveness and a great reward
49|1|o you who have believed do not put yourselves before allah and his messenger but fear allah indeed allah is hearing and knowing
49|2|o you who have believed do not raise your voices above the voice of the prophet or be loud to him in speech like the loudness of some of you to others lest your deeds become worthless while you perceive not
49|3|indeed those who lower their voices before the messenger of allah they are the ones whose hearts allah has tested for righteousness for them is forgiveness and great reward
49|4|indeed those who call you o muhammad from behind the chambers most of them do not use reason
49|5|and if they had been patient until you could come out to them it would have been better for them but allah is forgiving and merciful
49|6|o you who have believed if there comes to you a disobedient one with information investigate lest you harm a people out of ignorance and become over what you have done regretful
49|7|and know that among you is the messenger of allah if he were to obey you in much of the matter you would be in difficulty but allah has endeared to you the faith and has made it pleasing in your hearts and has made hateful to you disbelief defiance and disobedience those are the rightly guided
49|8|it is as bounty from allah and favor and allah is knowing and wise
49|9|and if two factions among the believers should fight then make settlement between the two but if one of them oppresses the other then fight against the one that oppresses until it returns to the ordinance of allah and if it returns then make settlement between them in justice and act justly indeed allah loves those who act justly
49|10|the believers are but brothers so make settlement between your brothers and fear allah that you may receive mercy
49|11|o you who have believed let not a people ridicule another people perhaps they may be better than them nor let women ridicule other women perhaps they may be better than them and do not insult one another and do not call each other by offensive nicknames wretched is the name of disobedience after one s faith and whoever does not repent then it is those who are the wrongdoers
49|12|o you who have believed avoid much negative assumption indeed some assumption is sin and do not spy or backbite each other would one of you like to eat the flesh of his brother when dead you would detest it and fear allah indeed allah is accepting of repentance and merciful
49|13|o mankind indeed we have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another indeed the most noble of you in the sight of allah is the most righteous of you indeed allah is knowing and acquainted
49|14|the bedouins say we have believed say you have not yet believed but say instead we have submitted for faith has not yet entered your hearts and if you obey allah and his messenger he will not deprive you from your deeds of anything indeed allah is forgiving and merciful
49|15|the believers are only the ones who have believed in allah and his messenger and then doubt not but strive with their properties and their lives in the cause of allah it is those who are the truthful
49|16|say would you acquaint allah with your religion while allah knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth and allah is knowing of all things
49|17|they consider it a favor to you that they have accepted islam say do not consider your islam a favor to me rather allah has conferred favor upon you that he has guided you to the faith if you should be truthful
49|18|indeed allah knows the unseen aspects of the heavens and the earth and allah is seeing of what you do
50|1|qaf by the honored qur an
50|2|but they wonder that there has come to them a warner from among themselves and the disbelievers say this is an amazing thing
50|3|when we have died and have become dust we will return to life that is a distant return
50|4|we know what the earth diminishes of them and with us is a retaining record
50|5|but they denied the truth when it came to them so they are in a confused condition
50|6|have they not looked at the heaven above them how we structured it and adorned it and how it has no rifts
50|7|and the earth we spread it out and cast therein firmly set mountains and made grow therein something of every beautiful kind
50|8|giving insight and a reminder for every servant who turns to allah
50|9|and we have sent down blessed rain from the sky and made grow thereby gardens and grain from the harvest
50|10|and lofty palm trees having fruit arranged in layers
50|11|as provision for the servants and we have given life thereby to a dead land thus is the resurrection
50|12|the people of noah denied before them and the companions of the well and thamud
50|13|and aad and pharaoh and the brothers of lot
50|14|and the companions of the thicket and the people of tubba all denied the messengers so my threat was justly fulfilled
50|15|did we fail in the first creation but they are in confusion over a new creation
50|16|and we have already created man and know what his soul whispers to him and we are closer to him than his jugular vein
50|17|when the two receivers receive seated on the right and on the left
50|18|man does not utter any word except that with him is an observer prepared to record
50|19|and the intoxication of death will bring the truth that is what you were trying to avoid
50|20|and the horn will be blown that is the day of carrying out the threat
50|21|and every soul will come with it a driver and a witness
50|22|it will be said you were certainly in unmindfulness of this and we have removed from you your cover so your sight this day is sharp
50|23|and his companion the angel will say this record is what is with me prepared
50|24|allah will say throw into hell every obstinate disbeliever
50|25|preventer of good aggressor and doubter
50|26|who made as equal with allah another deity then throw him into the severe punishment
50|27|his devil companion will say our lord i did not make him transgress but he himself was in extreme error
50|28|allah will say do not dispute before me while i had already presented to you the warning
50|29|the word will not be changed with me and never will i be unjust to the servants
50|30|on the day we will say to hell have you been filled and it will say are there some more
50|31|and paradise will be brought near to the righteous not far
50|32|it will be said this is what you were promised for every returner to allah and keeper of his covenant
50|33|who feared the most merciful unseen and came with a heart returning in repentance
50|34|enter it in peace this is the day of eternity
50|35|they will have whatever they wish therein and with us is more
50|36|and how many a generation before them did we destroy who were greater than them in striking power and had explored throughout the lands is there any place of escape
50|37|indeed in that is a reminder for whoever has a heart or who listens while he is present in mind
50|38|and we did certainly create the heavens and earth and what is between them in six days and there touched us no weariness
50|39|so be patient o muhammad over what they say and exalt allah with praise of your lord before the rising of the sun and before its setting
50|40|and in part of the night exalt him and after prostration
50|41|and listen on the day when the caller will call out from a place that is near
50|42|the day they will hear the blast of the horn in truth that is the day of emergence from the graves
50|43|indeed it is we who give life and cause death and to us is the destination
50|44|on the day the earth breaks away from them and they emerge rapidly that is a gathering easy for us
50|45|we are most knowing of what they say and you are not over them a tyrant but remind by the qur an whoever fears my threat
51|1|by those winds scattering dust dispersing
51|2|and those clouds carrying a load of water
51|3|and those ships sailing with ease
51|4|and those angels apportioning each matter
51|5|indeed what you are promised is true
51|6|and indeed the recompense is to occur
51|7|by the heaven containing pathways
51|8|indeed you are in differing speech
51|9|deluded away from the qur an is he who is deluded
51|10|destroyed are the falsifiers
51|11|who are within a flood of confusion and heedless
51|12|they ask when is the day of recompense
51|13|it is the day they will be tormented over the fire
51|14|and will be told taste your torment this is that for which you were impatient
51|15|indeed the righteous will be among gardens and springs
51|16|accepting what their lord has given them indeed they were before that doers of good
51|17|they used to sleep but little of the night
51|18|and in the hours before dawn they would ask forgiveness
51|19|and from their properties was given the right of the needy petitioner and the deprived
51|20|and on the earth are signs for the certain in faith
51|21|and in yourselves then will you not see
51|22|and in the heaven is your provision and whatever you are promised
51|23|then by the lord of the heaven and earth indeed it is truth just as sure as it is that you are speaking
51|24|has there reached you the story of the honored guests of abraham
51|25|when they entered upon him and said we greet you with peace he answered and upon you peace you are a people unknown
51|26|then he went to his family and came with a fat roasted calf
51|27|and placed it near them he said will you not eat
51|28|and he felt from them apprehension they said fear not and gave him good tidings of a learned boy
51|29|and his wife approached with a cry of alarm and struck her face and said i am a barren old woman
51|30|they said thus has said your lord indeed he is the wise the knowing
51|31|abraham said then what is your business here o messengers
51|32|they said indeed we have been sent to a people of criminals
51|33|to send down upon them stones of clay
51|34|marked in the presence of your lord for the transgressors
51|35|so we brought out whoever was in the cities of the believers
51|36|and we found not within them other than a single house of muslims
51|37|and we left therein a sign for those who fear the painful punishment
51|38|and in moses was a sign when we sent him to pharaoh with clear authority
51|39|but he turned away with his supporters and said a magician or a madman
51|40|so we took him and his soldiers and cast them into the sea and he was blameworthy
51|41|and in aad was a sign when we sent against them the barren wind
51|42|it left nothing of what it came upon but that it made it like disintegrated ruins
51|43|and in thamud when it was said to them enjoy yourselves for a time
51|44|but they were insolent toward the command of their lord so the thunderbolt seized them while they were looking on
51|45|and they were unable to arise nor could they defend themselves
51|46|and we destroyed the people of noah before indeed they were a people defiantly disobedient
51|47|and the heaven we constructed with strength and indeed we are its expander
51|48|and the earth we have spread out and excellent is the preparer
51|49|and of all things we created two mates perhaps you will remember
51|50|so flee to allah indeed i am to you from him a clear warner
51|51|and do not make as equal with allah another deity indeed i am to you from him a clear warner
51|52|similarly there came not to those before them any messenger except that they said a magician or a madman
51|53|did they suggest it to them rather they themselves are a transgressing people
51|54|so leave them o muhammad for you are not to be blamed
51|55|and remind for indeed the reminder benefits the believers
51|56|and i did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship me
51|57|i do not want from them any provision nor do i want them to feed me
51|58|indeed it is allah who is the continual provider the firm possessor of strength
51|59|and indeed for those who have wronged is a portion of punishment like the portion of their predecessors so let them not impatiently urge me
51|60|and woe to those who have disbelieved from their day which they are promised
52|1|by the mount
52|2|and by a book inscribed
52|3|in parchment spread open
52|4|and by the frequented house
52|5|and by the heaven raised high
52|6|and by the sea filled with fire
52|7|indeed the punishment of your lord will occur
52|8|of it there is no preventer
52|9|on the day the heaven will sway with circular motion
52|10|and the mountains will pass on departing
52|11|then woe that day to the deniers
52|12|who are in empty discourse amusing themselves
52|13|the day they are thrust toward the fire of hell with a violent thrust its angels will say
52|14|this is the fire which you used to deny
52|15|then is this magic or do you not see
52|16|enter to burn therein then be patient or impatient it is all the same for you you are only being recompensed for what you used to do
52|17|indeed the righteous will be in gardens and pleasure
52|18|enjoying what their lord has given them and their lord protected them from the punishment of hellfire
52|19|they will be told eat and drink in satisfaction for what you used to do
52|20|they will be reclining on thrones lined up and we will marry them to fair women with large beautiful eyes
52|21|and those who believed and whose descendants followed them in faith we will join with them their descendants and we will not deprive them of anything of their deeds every person for what he earned is retained
52|22|and we will provide them with fruit and meat from whatever they desire
52|23|they will exchange with one another a cup of wine wherein results no ill speech or commission of sin
52|24|there will circulate among them servant boys especially for them as if they were pearls well protected
52|25|and they will approach one another inquiring of each other
52|26|they will say indeed we were previously among our people fearful of displeasing allah
52|27|so allah conferred favor upon us and protected us from the punishment of the scorching fire
52|28|indeed we used to supplicate him before indeed it is he who is the beneficent the merciful
52|29|so remind o muhammad for you are not by the favor of your lord a soothsayer or a madman
52|30|or do they say of you a poet for whom we await a misfortune of time
52|31|say wait for indeed i am with you among the waiters
52|32|or do their minds command them to say this or are they a transgressing people
52|33|or do they say he has made it up rather they do not believe
52|34|then let them produce a statement like it if they should be truthful
52|35|or were they created by nothing or were they the creators of themselves
52|36|or did they create the heavens and the earth rather they are not certain
52|37|or have they the depositories containing the provision of your lord or are they the controllers of them
52|38|or have they a stairway into the heaven upon which they listen then let their listener produce a clear authority
52|39|or has he daughters while you have sons
52|40|or do you o muhammad ask of them a payment so they are by debt burdened down
52|41|or have they knowledge of the unseen so they write it down
52|42|or do they intend a plan but those who disbelieve they are the object of a plan
52|43|or have they a deity other than allah exalted is allah above whatever they associate with him
52|44|and if they were to see a fragment from the sky falling they would say it is merely clouds heaped up
52|45|so leave them until they meet their day in which they will be struck insensible
52|46|the day their plan will not avail them at all nor will they be helped
52|47|and indeed for those who have wronged is a punishment before that but most of them do not know
52|48|and be patient o muhammad for the decision of your lord for indeed you are in our eyes and exalt allah with praise of your lord when you arise
52|49|and in a part of the night exalt him and after the setting of the stars
53|1|by the star when it descends
53|2|your companion muhammad has not strayed nor has he erred
53|3|nor does he speak from his own inclination
53|4|it is not but a revelation revealed
53|5|taught to him by one intense in strength
53|6|one of soundness and he rose to his true form
53|7|while he was in the higher part of the horizon
53|8|then he approached and descended
53|9|and was at a distance of two bow lengths or nearer
53|10|and he revealed to his servant what he revealed
53|11|the heart did not lie about what it saw
53|12|so will you dispute with him over what he saw
53|13|and he certainly saw him in another descent
53|14|at the lote tree of the utmost boundary
53|15|near it is the garden of refuge
53|16|when there covered the lote tree that which covered it
53|17|the sight of the prophet did not swerve nor did it transgress its limit
53|18|he certainly saw of the greatest signs of his lord
53|19|so have you considered al lat and al uzza
53|20|and manat the third the other one
53|21|is the male for you and for him the female
53|22|that then is an unjust division
53|23|they are not but mere names you have named them you and your forefathers for which allah has sent down no authority they follow not except assumption and what their souls desire and there has already come to them from their lord guidance
53|24|or is there for man whatever he wishes
53|25|rather to allah belongs the hereafter and the first life
53|26|and how many angels there are in the heavens whose intercession will not avail at all except only after allah has permitted it to whom he wills and approves
53|27|indeed those who do not believe in the hereafter name the angels female names
53|28|and they have thereof no knowledge they follow not except assumption and indeed assumption avails not against the truth at all
53|29|so turn away from whoever turns his back on our message and desires not except the worldly life
53|30|that is their sum of knowledge indeed your lord is most knowing of who strays from his way and he is most knowing of who is guided
53|31|and to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth that he may recompense those who do evil with the penalty of what they have done and recompense those who do good with the best reward
53|32|those who avoid the major sins and immoralities only committing slight ones indeed your lord is vast in forgiveness he was most knowing of you when he produced you from the earth and when you were fetuses in the wombs of your mothers so do not claim yourselves to be pure he is most knowing of who fears him
53|33|have you seen the one who turned away
53|34|and gave a little and then refrained
53|35|does he have knowledge of the unseen so he sees
53|36|or has he not been informed of what was in the scriptures of moses
53|37|and of abraham who fulfilled his obligations
53|38|that no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another
53|39|and that there is not for man except that good for which he strives
53|40|and that his effort is going to be seen
53|41|then he will be recompensed for it with the fullest recompense
53|42|and that to your lord is the finality
53|43|and that it is he who makes one laugh and weep
53|44|and that it is he who causes death and gives life
53|45|and that he creates the two mates the male and female
53|46|from a sperm drop when it is emitted
53|47|and that incumbent upon him is the next creation
53|48|and that it is he who enriches and suffices
53|49|and that it is he who is the lord of sirius
53|50|and that he destroyed the first people of aad
53|51|and thamud and he did not spare them
53|52|and the people of noah before indeed it was they who were even more unjust and oppressing
53|53|and the overturned towns he hurled down
53|54|and covered them by that which he covered
53|55|then which of the favors of your lord do you doubt
53|56|this prophet is a warner like the former warners
53|57|the approaching day has approached
53|58|of it from those besides allah there is no remover
53|59|then at this statement do you wonder
53|60|and you laugh and do not weep
53|61|while you are proudly sporting
53|62|so prostrate to allah and worship him
54|1|the hour has come near and the moon has split in two
54|2|and if they see a miracle they turn away and say passing magic
54|3|and they denied and followed their inclinations but for every matter is a time of settlement
54|4|and there has already come to them of information that in which there is deterrence
54|5|extensive wisdom but warning does not avail them
54|6|so leave them o muhammad the day the caller calls to something forbidding
54|7|their eyes humbled they will emerge from the graves as if they were locusts spreading
54|8|racing ahead toward the caller the disbelievers will say this is a difficult day
54|9|the people of noah denied before them and they denied our servant and said a madman and he was repelled
54|10|so he invoked his lord indeed i am overpowered so help
54|11|then we opened the gates of the heaven with rain pouring down
54|12|and caused the earth to burst with springs and the waters met for a matter already predestined
54|13|and we carried him on a construction of planks and nails
54|14|sailing under our observation as reward for he who had been denied
54|15|and we left it as a sign so is there any who will remember
54|16|and how severe were my punishment and warning
54|17|and we have certainly made the qur an easy for remembrance so is there any who will remember
54|18|aad denied and how severe were my punishment and warning
54|19|indeed we sent upon them a screaming wind on a day of continuous misfortune
54|20|extracting the people as if they were trunks of palm trees uprooted
54|21|and how severe were my punishment and warning
54|22|and we have certainly made the qur an easy for remembrance so is there any who will remember
54|23|thamud denied the warning
54|24|and said is it one human being among us that we should follow indeed we would then be in error and madness
54|25|has the message been sent down upon him from among us rather he is an insolent liar
54|26|they will know tomorrow who is the insolent liar
54|27|indeed we are sending the she camel as trial for them so watch them and be patient
54|28|and inform them that the water is shared between them each day of drink attended by turn
54|29|but they called their companion and he dared and hamstrung her
54|30|and how severe were my punishment and warning
54|31|indeed we sent upon them one blast from the sky and they became like the dry twig fragments of an animal pen
54|32|and we have certainly made the qur an easy for remembrance so is there any who will remember
54|33|the people of lot denied the warning
54|34|indeed we sent upon them a storm of stones except the family of lot we saved them before dawn
54|35|as favor from us thus do we reward he who is grateful
54|36|and he had already warned them of our assault but they disputed the warning
54|37|and they had demanded from him his guests but we obliterated their eyes saying taste my punishment and warning
54|38|and there came upon them by morning an abiding punishment
54|39|so taste my punishment and warning
54|40|and we have certainly made the qur an easy for remembrance so is there any who will remember
54|41|and there certainly came to the people of pharaoh warning
54|42|they denied our signs all of them so we seized them with a seizure of one exalted in might and perfect in ability
54|43|are your disbelievers better than those former ones or have you immunity in the scripture
54|44|or do they say we are an assembly supporting each other
54|45|their assembly will be defeated and they will turn their backs in retreat
54|46|but the hour is their appointment for due punishment and the hour is more disastrous and more bitter
54|47|indeed the criminals are in error and madness
54|48|the day they are dragged into the fire on their faces it will be said taste the touch of saqar
54|49|indeed all things we created with predestination
54|50|and our command is but one like a glance of the eye
54|51|and we have already destroyed your kinds so is there any who will remember
54|52|and everything they did is in written records
54|53|and every small and great thing is inscribed
54|54|indeed the righteous will be among gardens and rivers
54|55|in a seat of honor near a sovereign perfect in ability
55|1|the most merciful
55|2|taught the qur an
55|3|created man
55|4|and taught him eloquence
55|5|the sun and the moon move by precise calculation
55|6|and the stars and trees prostrate
55|7|and the heaven he raised and imposed the balance
55|8|that you not transgress within the balance
55|9|and establish weight in justice and do not make deficient the balance
55|10|and the earth he laid out for the creatures
55|11|therein is fruit and palm trees having sheaths of dates
55|12|and grain having husks and scented plants
55|13|so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
55|14|he created man from clay like that of pottery
55|15|and he created the jinn from a smokeless flame of fire
55|16|so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
55|17|he is lord of the two sunrises and lord of the two sunsets
55|18|so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
55|19|he released the two seas meeting side by side
55|20|between them is a barrier so neither of them transgresses
55|21|so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
55|22|from both of them emerge pearl and coral
55|23|so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
55|24|and to him belong the ships with sails elevated in the sea like mountains
55|25|so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
55|26|everyone upon the earth will perish
55|27|and there will remain the face of your lord owner of majesty and honor
55|28|so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
55|29|whoever is within the heavens and earth asks him every day he is bringing about a matter
55|30|so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
55|31|we will attend to you o prominent beings
55|32|so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
55|33|o company of jinn and mankind if you are able to pass beyond the regions of the heavens and the earth then pass you will not pass except by authority from allah
55|34|so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
55|35|there will be sent upon you a flame of fire and smoke and you will not defend yourselves
55|36|so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
55|37|and when the heaven is split open and becomes rose colored like oil
55|38|so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
55|39|then on that day none will be asked about his sin among men or jinn
55|40|so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
55|41|the criminals will be known by their marks and they will be seized by the forelocks and the feet
55|42|so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
55|43|this is hell which the criminals deny
55|44|they will go around between it and scalding water heated to the utmost degree
55|45|so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
55|46|but for he who has feared the position of his lord are two gardens
55|47|so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
55|48|having spreading branches
55|49|so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
55|50|in both of them are two springs flowing
55|51|so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
55|52|in both of them are of every fruit two kinds
55|53|so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
55|54|they are reclining on beds whose linings are of silk brocade and the fruit of the two gardens is hanging low
55|55|so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
55|56|in them are women limiting their glances untouched before them by man or jinni
55|57|so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
55|58|as if they were rubies and coral
55|59|so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
55|60|is the reward for good anything but good
55|61|so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
55|62|and below them both in excellence are two other gardens
55|63|so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
55|64|dark green in color
55|65|so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
55|66|in both of them are two springs spouting
55|67|so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
55|68|in both of them are fruit and palm trees and pomegranates
55|69|so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
55|70|in them are good and beautiful women
55|71|so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
55|72|fair ones reserved in pavilions
55|73|so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
55|74|untouched before them by man or jinni
55|75|so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
55|76|reclining on green cushions and beautiful fine carpets
55|77|so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
55|78|blessed is the name of your lord owner of majesty and honor
56|1|when the occurrence occurs
56|2|there is at its occurrence no denial
56|3|it will bring down some and raise up others
56|4|when the earth is shaken with convulsion
56|5|and the mountains are broken down crumbling
56|6|and become dust dispersing
56|7|and you become of three kinds
56|8|then the companions of the right what are the companions of the right
56|9|and the companions of the left what are the companions of the left
56|10|and the forerunners the forerunners
56|11|those are the ones brought near to allah
56|12|in the gardens of pleasure
56|13|a large company of the former peoples
56|14|and a few of the later peoples
56|15|on thrones woven with ornament
56|16|reclining on them facing each other
56|17|there will circulate among them young boys made eternal
56|18|with vessels pitchers and a cup of wine from a flowing spring
56|19|no headache will they have therefrom nor will they be intoxicated
56|20|and fruit of what they select
56|21|and the meat of fowl from whatever they desire
56|22|and for them are fair women with large beautiful eyes
56|23|the likenesses of pearls well protected
56|24|as reward for what they used to do
56|25|they will not hear therein ill speech or commission of sin
56|26|only a saying peace peace
56|27|the companions of the right what are the companions of the right
56|28|they will be among lote trees with thorns removed
56|29|and banana trees layered with fruit
56|30|and shade extended
56|31|and water poured out
56|32|and fruit abundant and varied
56|33|neither limited to season nor forbidden
56|34|and upon beds raised high
56|35|indeed we have produced the women of paradise in a new creation
56|36|and made them virgins
56|37|devoted to their husbands and of equal age
56|38|for the companions of the right who are
56|39|a company of the former peoples
56|40|and a company of the later peoples
56|41|and the companions of the left what are the companions of the left
56|42|they will be in scorching fire and scalding water
56|43|and a shade of black smoke
56|44|neither cool nor beneficial
56|45|indeed they were before that indulging in affluence
56|46|and they used to persist in the great violation
56|47|and they used to say when we die and become dust and bones are we indeed to be resurrected
56|48|and our forefathers as well
56|49|say o muhammad indeed the former and the later peoples
56|50|are to be gathered together for the appointment of a known day
56|51|then indeed you o those astray who are deniers
56|52|will be eating from trees of zaqqum
56|53|and filling with it your bellies
56|54|and drinking on top of it from scalding water
56|55|and will drink as the drinking of thirsty camels
56|56|that is their accommodation on the day of recompense
56|57|we have created you so why do you not believe
56|58|have you seen that which you emit
56|59|is it you who creates it or are we the creator
56|60|we have decreed death among you and we are not to be outdone
56|61|in that we will change your likenesses and produce you in that form which you do not know
56|62|and you have already known the first creation so will you not remember
56|63|and have you seen that seed which you sow
56|64|is it you who makes it grow or are we the grower
56|65|if we willed we could make it dry debris and you would remain in wonder
56|66|saying indeed we are now in debt
56|67|rather we have been deprived
56|68|and have you seen the water that you drink
56|69|is it you who brought it down from the clouds or is it we who bring it down
56|70|if we willed we could make it bitter so why are you not grateful
56|71|and have you seen the fire that you ignite
56|72|is it you who produced its tree or are we the producer
56|73|we have made it a reminder and provision for the travelers
56|74|so exalt the name of your lord the most great
56|75|then i swear by the setting of the stars
56|76|and indeed it is an oath if you could know most great
56|77|indeed it is a noble qur an
56|78|in a register well protected
56|79|none touch it except the purified
56|80|it is a revelation from the lord of the worlds
56|81|then is it to this statement that you are indifferent
56|82|and make the thanks for your provision that you deny the provider
56|83|then why when the soul at death reaches the throat
56|84|and you are at that time looking on
56|85|and our angels are nearer to him than you but you do not see
56|86|then why do you not if you are not to be recompensed
56|87|bring it back if you should be truthful
56|88|and if the deceased was of those brought near to allah
56|89|then for him is rest and bounty and a garden of pleasure
56|90|and if he was of the companions of the right
56|91|then the angels will say peace for you you are from the companions of the right
56|92|but if he was of the deniers who were astray
56|93|then for him is accommodation of scalding water
56|94|and burning in hellfire
56|95|indeed this is the true certainty
56|96|so exalt the name of your lord the most great
57|1|whatever is in the heavens and earth exalts allah and he is the exalted in might the wise
57|2|his is the dominion of the heavens and earth he gives life and causes death and he is over all things competent
57|3|he is the first and the last the ascendant and the intimate and he is of all things knowing
57|4|it is he who created the heavens and earth in six days and then established himself above the throne he knows what penetrates into the earth and what emerges from it and what descends from the heaven and what ascends therein and he is with you wherever you are and allah of what you do is seeing
57|5|his is the dominion of the heavens and earth and to allah are returned all matters
57|6|he causes the night to enter the day and causes the day to enter the night and he is knowing of that within the breasts
57|7|believe in allah and his messenger and spend out of that in which he has made you successors for those who have believed among you and spent there will be a great reward
57|8|and why do you not believe in allah while the messenger invites you to believe in your lord and he has taken your covenant if you should truly be believers
57|9|it is he who sends down upon his servant muhammad verses of clear evidence that he may bring you out from darknesses into the light and indeed allah is to you kind and merciful
57|10|and why do you not spend in the cause of allah while to allah belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth not equal among you are those who spent before the conquest of makkah and fought and those who did so after it those are greater in degree than they who spent afterwards and fought but to all allah has promised the best reward and allah with what you do is acquainted
57|11|who is it that would loan allah a goodly loan so he will multiply it for him and he will have a noble reward
57|12|on the day you see the believing men and believing women their light proceeding before them and on their right it will be said your good tidings today are of gardens beneath which rivers flow wherein you will abide eternally that is what is the great attainment
57|13|on the same day the hypocrite men and hypocrite women will say to those who believed wait for us that we may acquire some of your light it will be said go back behind you and seek light and a wall will be placed between them with a door its interior containing mercy but on the outside of it is torment
57|14|the hypocrites will call to the believers were we not with you they will say yes but you afflicted yourselves and awaited misfortune for us and doubted and wishful thinking deluded you until there came the command of allah and the deceiver deceived you concerning allah
57|15|so today no ransom will be taken from you or from those who disbelieved your refuge is the fire it is most worthy of you and wretched is the destination
57|16|has the time not come for those who have believed that their hearts should become humbly submissive at the remembrance of allah and what has come down of the truth and let them not be like those who were given the scripture before and a long period passed over them so their hearts hardened and many of them are defiantly disobedient
57|17|know that allah gives life to the earth after its lifelessness we have made clear to you the signs perhaps you will understand
57|18|indeed the men who practice charity and the women who practice charity and they who have loaned allah a goodly loan it will be multiplied for them and they will have a noble reward
57|19|and those who have believed in allah and his messengers those are in the ranks of the supporters of truth and the martyrs with their lord for them is their reward and their light but those who have disbelieved and denied our verses those are the companions of hellfire
57|20|know that the life of this world is but amusement and diversion and adornment and boasting to one another and competition in increase of wealth and children like the example of a rain whose resulting plant growth pleases the tillers then it dries and you see it turned yellow then it becomes scattered debris and in the hereafter is severe punishment and forgiveness from allah and approval and what is the worldly life except the enjoyment of delusion
57|21|race toward forgiveness from your lord and a garden whose width is like the width of the heavens and earth prepared for those who believed in allah and his messengers that is the bounty of allah which he gives to whom he wills and allah is the possessor of great bounty
57|22|no disaster strikes upon the earth or among yourselves except that it is in a register before we bring it into being indeed that for allah is easy
57|23|in order that you not despair over what has eluded you and not exult in pride over what he has given you and allah does not like everyone self deluded and boastful
57|24|those who are stingy and enjoin upon people stinginess and whoever turns away then indeed allah is the free of need the praiseworthy
57|25|we have already sent our messengers with clear evidences and sent down with them the scripture and the balance that the people may maintain their affairs in justice and we sent down iron wherein is great military might and benefits for the people and so that allah may make evident those who support him and his messengers unseen indeed allah is powerful and exalted in might
57|26|and we have already sent noah and abraham and placed in their descendants prophethood and scripture and among them is he who is guided but many of them are defiantly disobedient
57|27|then we sent following their footsteps our messengers and followed them with jesus the son of mary and gave him the gospel and we placed in the hearts of those who followed him compassion and mercy and monasticism which they innovated we did not prescribe it for them except that they did so seeking the approval of allah but they did not observe it with due observance so we gave the ones who believed among them their reward but many of them are defiantly disobedient
57|28|o you who have believed fear allah and believe in his messenger he will then give you a double portion of his mercy and make for you a light by which you will walk and forgive you and allah is forgiving and merciful
57|29|this is so that the people of the scripture may know that they are not able to obtain anything from the bounty of allah and that all bounty is in the hand of allah he gives it to whom he wills and allah is the possessor of great bounty
58|1|certainly has allah heard the speech of the one who argues with you o muhammad concerning her husband and directs her complaint to allah and allah hears your dialogue indeed allah is hearing and seeing
58|2|those who pronounce thihar among you to separate from their wives they are not consequently their mothers their mothers are none but those who gave birth to them and indeed they are saying an objectionable statement and a falsehood but indeed allah is pardoning and forgiving
58|3|and those who pronounce thihar from their wives and then wish to go back on what they said then there must be the freeing of a slave before they touch one another that is what you are admonished thereby and allah is acquainted with what you do
58|4|and he who does not find a slave then a fast for two months consecutively before they touch one another and he who is unable then the feeding of sixty poor persons that is for you to believe completely in allah and his messenger and those are the limits set by allah and for the disbelievers is a painful punishment
58|5|indeed those who oppose allah and his messenger are abased as those before them were abased and we have certainly sent down verses of clear evidence and for the disbelievers is a humiliating punishment
58|6|on the day when allah will resurrect them all and inform them of what they did allah had enumerated it while they forgot it and allah is over all things witness
58|7|have you not considered that allah knows what is in the heavens and what is on the earth there is in no private conversation three but that he is the fourth of them nor are there five but that he is the sixth of them and no less than that and no more except that he is with them in knowledge wherever they are then he will inform them of what they did on the day of resurrection indeed allah is of all things knowing
58|8|have you not considered those who were forbidden from private conversation then they return to that which they were forbidden and converse among themselves about sin and aggression and disobedience to the messenger and when they come to you they greet you with that word by which allah does not greet you and say among themselves why does allah not punish us for what we say sufficient for them is hell which they will enter to burn and wretched is the destination
58|9|o you who have believed when you converse privately do not converse about sin and aggression and disobedience to the messenger but converse about righteousness and piety and fear allah to whom you will be gathered
58|10|private conversation is only from satan that he may grieve those who have believed but he will not harm them at all except by permission of allah and upon allah let the believers rely
58|11|o you who have believed when you are told space yourselves in assemblies then make space allah will make space for you and when you are told arise then arise allah will raise those who have believed among you and those who were given knowledge by degrees and allah is acquainted with what you do
58|12|o you who have believed when you wish to privately consult the messenger present before your consultation a charity that is better for you and purer but if you find not the means then indeed allah is forgiving and merciful
58|13|have you feared to present before your consultation charities then when you do not and allah has forgiven you then at least establish prayer and give zakah and obey allah and his messenger and allah is acquainted with what you do
58|14|have you not considered those who make allies of a people with whom allah has become angry they are neither of you nor of them and they swear to untruth while they know they are lying
58|15|allah has prepared for them a severe punishment indeed it was evil that they were doing
58|16|they took their false oaths as a cover so they averted people from the way of allah and for them is a humiliating punishment
58|17|never will their wealth or their children avail them against allah at all those are the companions of the fire they will abide therein eternally
58|18|on the day allah will resurrect them all and they will swear to him as they swear to you and think that they are standing on something unquestionably it is they who are the liars
58|19|satan has overcome them and made them forget the remembrance of allah those are the party of satan unquestionably the party of satan they will be the losers
58|20|indeed the ones who oppose allah and his messenger those will be among the most humbled
58|21|allah has written i will surely overcome i and my messengers indeed allah is powerful and exalted in might
58|22|you will not find a people who believe in allah and the last day having affection for those who oppose allah and his messenger even if they were their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kindred those he has decreed within their hearts faith and supported them with spirit from him and we will admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow wherein they abide eternally allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with him those are the party of allah unquestionably the party of allah they are the successful
59|1|whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth exalts allah and he is the exalted in might the wise
59|2|it is he who expelled the ones who disbelieved among the people of the scripture from their homes at the first gathering you did not think they would leave and they thought that their fortresses would protect them from allah but the decree of allah came upon them from where they had not expected and he cast terror into their hearts so they destroyed their houses by their own hands and the hands of the believers so take warning o people of vision
59|3|and if not that allah had decreed for them evacuation he would have punished them in this world and for them in the hereafter is the punishment of the fire
59|4|that is because they opposed allah and his messenger and whoever opposes allah then indeed allah is severe in penalty
59|5|whatever you have cut down of their palm trees or left standing on their trunks it was by permission of allah and so he would disgrace the defiantly disobedient
59|6|and what allah restored of property to his messenger from them you did not spur for it in an expedition any horses or camels but allah gives his messengers power over whom he wills and allah is over all things competent
59|7|and what allah restored to his messenger from the people of the towns it is for allah and for the messenger and for his near relatives and orphans and the stranded traveler so that it will not be a perpetual distribution among the rich from among you and whatever the messenger has given you take and what he has forbidden you refrain from and fear allah indeed allah is severe in penalty
59|8|for the poor emigrants who were expelled from their homes and their properties seeking bounty from allah and his approval and supporting allah and his messenger there is also a share those are the truthful
59|9|and also for those who were settled in al madinah and adopted the faith before them they love those who emigrated to them and find not any want in their breasts of what the emigrants were given but give them preference over themselves even though they are in privation and whoever is protected from the stinginess of his soul it is those who will be the successful
59|10|and there is a share for those who came after them saying our lord forgive us and our brothers who preceded us in faith and put not in our hearts any resentment toward those who have believed our lord indeed you are kind and merciful
59|11|have you not considered those who practice hypocrisy saying to their brothers who have disbelieved among the people of the scripture if you are expelled we will surely leave with you and we will not obey in regard to you anyone ever and if you are fought we will surely aid you but allah testifies that they are liars
59|12|if they are expelled they will not leave with them and if they are fought they will not aid them and even if they should aid them they will surely turn their backs then thereafter they will not be aided
59|13|you believers are more fearful within their breasts than allah that is because they are a people who do not understand
59|14|they will not fight you all except within fortified cities or from behind walls their violence among themselves is severe you think they are together but their hearts are diverse that is because they are a people who do not reason
59|15|theirs is like the example of those shortly before them they tasted the bad consequence of their affair and they will have a painful punishment
59|16|the hypocrites are like the example of satan when he says to man disbelieve but when he disbelieves he says indeed i am disassociated from you indeed i fear allah lord of the worlds
59|17|so the outcome for both of them is that they will be in the fire abiding eternally therein and that is the recompense of the wrong doers
59|18|o you who have believed fear allah and let every soul look to what it has put forth for tomorrow and fear allah indeed allah is acquainted with what you do
59|19|and be not like those who forgot allah so he made them forget themselves those are the defiantly disobedient
59|20|not equal are the companions of the fire and the companions of paradise the companions of paradise they are the attainers of success
59|21|if we had sent down this qur an upon a mountain you would have seen it humbled and coming apart from fear of allah and these examples we present to the people that perhaps they will give thought
59|22|he is allah other than whom there is no deity knower of the unseen and the witnessed he is the entirely merciful the especially merciful
59|23|he is allah other than whom there is no deity the sovereign the pure the perfection the bestower of faith the overseer the exalted in might the compeller the superior exalted is allah above whatever they associate with him
59|24|he is allah the creator the inventor the fashioner to him belong the best names whatever is in the heavens and earth is exalting him and he is the exalted in might the wise
60|1|o you who have believed do not take my enemies and your enemies as allies extending to them affection while they have disbelieved in what came to you of the truth having driven out the prophet and yourselves only because you believe in allah your lord if you have come out for jihad in my cause and seeking means to my approval take them not as friends you confide to them affection but i am most knowing of what you have concealed and what you have declared and whoever does it among you has certainly strayed from the soundness of the way
60|2|if they gain dominance over you they would be to you as enemies and extend against you their hands and their tongues with evil and they wish you would disbelieve
60|3|never will your relatives or your children benefit you the day of resurrection he will judge between you and allah of what you do is seeing
60|4|there has already been for you an excellent pattern in abraham and those with him when they said to their people indeed we are disassociated from you and from whatever you worship other than allah we have denied you and there has appeared between us and you animosity and hatred forever until you believe in allah alone except for the saying of abraham to his father i will surely ask forgiveness for you but i have not power to do for you anything against allah our lord upon you we have relied and to you we have returned and to you is the destination
60|5|our lord make us not objects of torment for the disbelievers and forgive us our lord indeed it is you who is the exalted in might the wise
60|6|there has certainly been for you in them an excellent pattern for anyone whose hope is in allah and the last day and whoever turns away then indeed allah is the free of need the praiseworthy
60|7|perhaps allah will put between you and those to whom you have been enemies among them affection and allah is competent and allah is forgiving and merciful
60|8|allah does not forbid you from those who do not fight you because of religion and do not expel you from your homes from being righteous toward them and acting justly toward them indeed allah loves those who act justly
60|9|allah only forbids you from those who fight you because of religion and expel you from your homes and aid in your expulsion forbids that you make allies of them and whoever makes allies of them then it is those who are the wrongdoers
60|10|o you who have believed when the believing women come to you as emigrants examine them allah is most knowing as to their faith and if you know them to be believers then do not return them to the disbelievers they are not lawful wives for them nor are they lawful husbands for them but give the disbelievers what they have spent and there is no blame upon you if you marry them when you have given them their due compensation and hold not to marriage bonds with disbelieving women but ask for what you have spent and let them ask for what they have spent that is the judgement of allah he judges between you and allah is knowing and wise
60|11|and if you have lost any of your wives to the disbelievers and you subsequently obtain something then give those whose wives have gone the equivalent of what they had spent and fear allah in whom you are believers
60|12|o prophet when the believing women come to you pledging to you that they will not associate anything with allah nor will they steal nor will they commit unlawful sexual intercourse nor will they kill their children nor will they bring forth a slander they have invented between their arms and legs nor will they disobey you in what is right then accept their pledge and ask forgiveness for them of allah indeed allah is forgiving and merciful
60|13|o you who have believed do not make allies of a people with whom allah has become angry they have despaired of reward in the hereafter just as the disbelievers have despaired of meeting the inhabitants of the graves
61|1|whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth exalts allah and he is the exalted in might the wise
61|2|o you who have believed why do you say what you do not do
61|3|great is hatred in the sight of allah that you say what you do not do
61|4|indeed allah loves those who fight in his cause in a row as though they are a single structure joined firmly
61|5|and mention o muhammad when moses said to his people o my people why do you harm me while you certainly know that i am the messenger of allah to you and when they deviated allah caused their hearts to deviate and allah does not guide the defiantly disobedient people
61|6|and mention when jesus the son of mary said o children of israel indeed i am the messenger of allah to you confirming what came before me of the torah and bringing good tidings of a messenger to come after me whose name is ahmad but when he came to them with clear evidences they said this is obvious magic
61|7|and who is more unjust than one who invents about allah untruth while he is being invited to islam and allah does not guide the wrongdoing people
61|8|they want to extinguish the light of allah with their mouths but allah will perfect his light although the disbelievers dislike it
61|9|it is he who sent his messenger with guidance and the religion of truth to manifest it over all religion although those who associate others with allah dislike it
61|10|o you who have believed shall i guide you to a transaction that will save you from a painful punishment
61|11|it is that you believe in allah and his messenger and strive in the cause of allah with your wealth and your lives that is best for you if you should know
61|12|he will forgive for you your sins and admit you to gardens beneath which rivers flow and pleasant dwellings in gardens of perpetual residence that is the great attainment
61|13|and you will obtain another favor that you love victory from allah and an imminent conquest and give good tidings to the believers
61|14|o you who have believed be supporters of allah as when jesus the son of mary said to the disciples who are my supporters for allah the disciples said we are supporters of allah and a faction of the children of israel believed and a faction disbelieved so we supported those who believed against their enemy and they became dominant
62|1|whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth is exalting allah the sovereign the pure the exalted in might the wise
62|2|it is he who has sent among the unlettered a messenger from themselves reciting to them his verses and purifying them and teaching them the book and wisdom although they were before in clear error
62|3|and to others of them who have not yet joined them and he is the exalted in might the wise
62|4|that is the bounty of allah which he gives to whom he wills and allah is the possessor of great bounty
62|5|the example of those who were entrusted with the torah and then did not take it on is like that of a donkey who carries volumes of books wretched is the example of the people who deny the signs of allah and allah does not guide the wrongdoing people
62|6|say o you who are jews if you claim that you are allies of allah excluding the other people then wish for death if you should be truthful
62|7|but they will not wish for it ever because of what their hands have put forth and allah is knowing of the wrongdoers
62|8|say indeed the death from which you flee indeed it will meet you then you will be returned to the knower of the unseen and the witnessed and he will inform you about what you used to do
62|9|o you who have believed when the adhan is called for the prayer on the day of jumu ah friday then proceed to the remembrance of allah and leave trade that is better for you if you only knew
62|10|and when the prayer has been concluded disperse within the land and seek from the bounty of allah and remember allah often that you may succeed
62|11|but when they saw a transaction or a diversion o muhammad they rushed to it and left you standing say what is with allah is better than diversion and than a transaction and allah is the best of providers
63|1|when the hypocrites come to you o muhammad they say we testify that you are the messenger of allah and allah knows that you are his messenger and allah testifies that the hypocrites are liars
63|2|they have taken their oaths as a cover so they averted people from the way of allah indeed it was evil that they were doing
63|3|that is because they believed and then they disbelieved so their hearts were sealed over and they do not understand
63|4|and when you see them their forms please you and if they speak you listen to their speech they are as if they were pieces of wood propped up they think that every shout is against them they are the enemy so beware of them may allah destroy them how are they deluded
63|5|and when it is said to them come the messenger of allah will ask forgiveness for you they turn their heads aside and you see them evading while they are arrogant
63|6|it is all the same for them whether you ask forgiveness for them or do not ask forgiveness for them never will allah forgive them indeed allah does not guide the defiantly disobedient people
63|7|they are the ones who say do not spend on those who are with the messenger of allah until they disband and to allah belongs the depositories of the heavens and the earth but the hypocrites do not understand
63|8|they say if we return to al madinah the more honored for power will surely expel therefrom the more humble and to allah belongs all honor and to his messenger and to the believers but the hypocrites do not know
63|9|o you who have believed let not your wealth and your children divert you from remembrance of allah and whoever does that then those are the losers
63|10|and spend in the way of allah from what we have provided you before death approaches one of you and he says my lord if only you would delay me for a brief term so i would give charity and be among the righteous
63|11|but never will allah delay a soul when its time has come and allah is acquainted with what you do
64|1|whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth is exalting allah to him belongs dominion and to him belongs all praise and he is over all things competent
64|2|it is he who created you and among you is the disbeliever and among you is the believer and allah of what you do is seeing
64|3|he created the heavens and earth in truth and formed you and perfected your forms and to him is the final destination
64|4|he knows what is within the heavens and earth and knows what you conceal and what you declare and allah is knowing of that within the breasts
64|5|has there not come to you the news of those who disbelieved before so they tasted the bad consequence of their affair and they will have a painful punishment
64|6|that is because their messengers used to come to them with clear evidences but they said shall human beings guide us and disbelieved and turned away and allah dispensed with them and allah is free of need and praiseworthy
64|7|those who disbelieve have claimed that they will never be resurrected say yes by my lord you will surely be resurrected then you will surely be informed of what you did and that for allah is easy
64|8|so believe in allah and his messenger and the qur an which we have sent down and allah is acquainted with what you do
64|9|the day he will assemble you for the day of assembly that is the day of deprivation and whoever believes in allah and does righteousness he will remove from him his misdeeds and admit him to gardens beneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide forever that is the great attainment
64|10|but the ones who disbelieved and denied our verses those are the companions of the fire abiding eternally therein and wretched is the destination
64|11|no disaster strikes except by permission of allah and whoever believes in allah he will guide his heart and allah is knowing of all things
64|12|and obey allah and obey the messenger but if you turn away then upon our messenger is only the duty of clear notification
64|13|allah there is no deity except him and upon allah let the believers rely
64|14|o you who have believed indeed among your wives and your children are enemies to you so beware of them but if you pardon and overlook and forgive then indeed allah is forgiving and merciful
64|15|your wealth and your children are but a trial and allah has with him a great reward
64|16|so fear allah as much as you are able and listen and obey and spend in the way of allah it is better for your selves and whoever is protected from the stinginess of his soul it is those who will be the successful
64|17|if you loan allah a goodly loan he will multiply it for you and forgive you and allah is most appreciative and forbearing
64|18|knower of the unseen and the witnessed the exalted in might the wise
65|1|o prophet when you muslims divorce women divorce them for the commencement of their waiting period and keep count of the waiting period and fear allah your lord do not turn them out of their husbands houses nor should they themselves leave during that period unless they are committing a clear immorality and those are the limits set by allah and whoever transgresses the limits of allah has certainly wronged himself you know not perhaps allah will bring about after that a different matter
65|2|and when they have nearly fulfilled their term either retain them according to acceptable terms or part with them according to acceptable terms and bring to witness two just men from among you and establish the testimony for the acceptance of allah that is instructed to whoever should believe in allah and the last day and whoever fears allah he will make for him a way out
65|3|and will provide for him from where he does not expect and whoever relies upon allah then he is sufficient for him indeed allah will accomplish his purpose allah has already set for everything a decreed extent
65|4|and those who no longer expect menstruation among your women if you doubt then their period is three months and also for those who have not menstruated and for those who are pregnant their term is until they give birth and whoever fears allah he will make for him of his matter ease
65|5|that is the command of allah which he has sent down to you and whoever fears allah he will remove for him his misdeeds and make great for him his reward
65|6|lodge them in a section of where you dwell out of your means and do not harm them in order to oppress them and if they should be pregnant then spend on them until they give birth and if they breastfeed for you then give them their payment and confer among yourselves in the acceptable way but if you are in discord then there may breastfeed for the father another woman
65|7|let a man of wealth spend from his wealth and he whose provision is restricted let him spend from what allah has given him allah does not charge a soul except according to what he has given it allah will bring about after hardship ease
65|8|and how many a city was insolent toward the command of its lord and his messengers so we took it to severe account and punished it with a terrible punishment
65|9|and it tasted the bad consequence of its affair and the outcome of its affair was loss
65|10|allah has prepared for them a severe punishment so fear allah o you of understanding who have believed allah has sent down to you the qur an
65|11|he sent a messenger muhammad reciting to you the distinct verses of allah that he may bring out those who believe and do righteous deeds from darknesses into the light and whoever believes in allah and does righteousness he will admit him into gardens beneath which rivers flow to abide therein forever allah will have perfected for him a provision
65|12|it is allah who has created seven heavens and of the earth the like of them his command descends among them so you may know that allah is over all things competent and that allah has encompassed all things in knowledge
66|1|o prophet why do you prohibit yourself from what allah has made lawful for you seeking the approval of your wives and allah is forgiving and merciful
66|2|allah has already ordained for you muslims the dissolution of your oaths and allah is your protector and he is the knowing the wise
66|3|and remember when the prophet confided to one of his wives a statement and when she informed another of it and allah showed it to him he made known part of it and ignored a part and when he informed her about it she said who told you this he said i was informed by the knowing the acquainted
66|4|if you two wives repent to allah it is best for your hearts have deviated but if you cooperate against him then indeed allah is his protector and gabriel and the righteous of the believers and the angels moreover are his assistants
66|5|perhaps his lord if he divorced you all would substitute for him wives better than you submitting to allah believing devoutly obedient repentant worshipping and traveling ones previously married and virgins
66|6|o you who have believed protect yourselves and your families from a fire whose fuel is people and stones over which are appointed angels harsh and severe they do not disobey allah in what he commands them but do what they are commanded
66|7|o you who have disbelieved make no excuses that day you will only be recompensed for what you used to do
66|8|o you who have believed repent to allah with sincere repentance perhaps your lord will remove from you your misdeeds and admit you into gardens beneath which rivers flow on the day when allah will not disgrace the prophet and those who believed with him their light will proceed before them and on their right they will say our lord perfect for us our light and forgive us indeed you are over all things competent
66|9|o prophet strive against the disbelievers and the hypocrites and be harsh upon them and their refuge is hell and wretched is the destination
66|10|allah presents an example of those who disbelieved the wife of noah and the wife of lot they were under two of our righteous servants but betrayed them so those prophets did not avail them from allah at all and it was said enter the fire with those who enter
66|11|and allah presents an example of those who believed the wife of pharaoh when she said my lord build for me near you a house in paradise and save me from pharaoh and his deeds and save me from the wrongdoing people
66|12|and the example of mary the daughter of imran who guarded her chastity so we blew into her garment through our angel and she believed in the words of her lord and his scriptures and was of the devoutly obedient
67|1|blessed is he in whose hand is dominion and he is over all things competent
67|2|he who created death and life to test you as to which of you is best in deed and he is the exalted in might the forgiving
67|3|and who created seven heavens in layers you do not see in the creation of the most merciful any inconsistency so return your vision to the sky do you see any breaks
67|4|then return your vision twice again your vision will return to you humbled while it is fatigued
67|5|and we have certainly beautified the nearest heaven with stars and have made from them what is thrown at the devils and have prepared for them the punishment of the blaze
67|6|and for those who disbelieved in their lord is the punishment of hell and wretched is the destination
67|7|when they are thrown into it they hear from it a dreadful inhaling while it boils up
67|8|it almost bursts with rage every time a company is thrown into it its keepers ask them did there not come to you a warner
67|9|they will say yes a warner had come to us but we denied and said allah has not sent down anything you are not but in great error
67|10|and they will say if only we had been listening or reasoning we would not be among the companions of the blaze
67|11|and they will admit their sin so it is alienation for the companions of the blaze
67|12|indeed those who fear their lord unseen will have forgiveness and great reward
67|13|and conceal your speech or publicize it indeed he is knowing of that within the breasts
67|14|does he who created not know while he is the subtle the acquainted
67|15|it is he who made the earth tame for you so walk among its slopes and eat of his provision and to him is the resurrection
67|16|do you feel secure that he who holds authority in the heaven would not cause the earth to swallow you and suddenly it would sway
67|17|or do you feel secure that he who holds authority in the heaven would not send against you a storm of stones then you would know how severe was my warning
67|18|and already had those before them denied and how terrible was my reproach
67|19|do they not see the birds above them with wings outspread and sometimes folded in none holds them aloft except the most merciful indeed he is of all things seeing
67|20|or who is it that could be an army for you to aid you other than the most merciful the disbelievers are not but in delusion
67|21|or who is it that could provide for you if he withheld his provision but they have persisted in insolence and aversion
67|22|then is one who walks fallen on his face better guided or one who walks erect on a straight path
67|23|say it is he who has produced you and made for you hearing and vision and hearts little are you grateful
67|24|say it is he who has multiplied you throughout the earth and to him you will be gathered
67|25|and they say when is this promise if you should be truthful
67|26|say the knowledge is only with allah and i am only a clear warner
67|27|but when they see it approaching the faces of those who disbelieve will be distressed and it will be said this is that for which you used to call
67|28|say o muhammad have you considered whether allah should cause my death and those with me or have mercy upon us who can protect the disbelievers from a painful punishment
67|29|say he is the most merciful we have believed in him and upon him we have relied and you will come to know who it is that is in clear error
67|30|say have you considered if your water was to become sunken into the earth then who could bring you flowing water
68|1|nun by the pen and what they inscribe
68|2|you are not o muhammad by the favor of your lord a madman
68|3|and indeed for you is a reward uninterrupted
68|4|and indeed you are of a great moral character
68|5|so you will see and they will see
68|6|which of you is the afflicted by a devil
68|7|indeed your lord is most knowing of who has gone astray from his way and he is most knowing of the rightly guided
68|8|then do not obey the deniers
68|9|they wish that you would soften in your position so they would soften toward you
68|10|and do not obey every worthless habitual swearer
68|11|and scorner going about with malicious gossip
68|12|a preventer of good transgressing and sinful
68|13|cruel moreover and an illegitimate pretender
68|14|because he is a possessor of wealth and children
68|15|when our verses are recited to him he says legends of the former peoples
68|16|we will brand him upon the snout
68|17|indeed we have tried them as we tried the companions of the garden when they swore to cut its fruit in the early morning
68|18|without making exception
68|19|so there came upon the garden an affliction from your lord while they were asleep
68|20|and it became as though reaped
68|21|and they called one another at morning
68|22|saying go early to your crop if you would cut the fruit
68|23|so they set out while lowering their voices
68|24|saying there will surely not enter it today upon you any poor person
68|25|and they went early in determination assuming themselves able
68|26|but when they saw it they said indeed we are lost
68|27|rather we have been deprived
68|28|the most moderate of them said did i not say to you why do you not exalt allah
68|29|they said exalted is our lord indeed we were wrongdoers
68|30|then they approached one another blaming each other
68|31|they said o woe to us indeed we were transgressors
68|32|perhaps our lord will substitute for us one better than it indeed we are toward our lord desirous
68|33|such is the punishment of this world and the punishment of the hereafter is greater if they only knew
68|34|indeed for the righteous with their lord are the gardens of pleasure
68|35|then will we treat the muslims like the criminals
68|36|what is the matter with you how do you judge
68|37|or do you have a scripture in which you learn
68|38|that indeed for you is whatever you choose
68|39|or do you have oaths binding upon us extending until the day of resurrection that indeed for you is whatever you judge
68|40|ask them which of them for that claim is responsible
68|41|or do they have partners then let them bring their partners if they should be truthful
68|42|the day the shin will be uncovered and they are invited to prostration but the disbelievers will not be able
68|43|their eyes humbled humiliation will cover them and they used to be invited to prostration while they were sound
68|44|so leave me o muhammad with the matter of whoever denies the qur an we will progressively lead them to punishment from where they do not know
68|45|and i will give them time indeed my plan is firm
68|46|or do you ask of them a payment so they are by debt burdened down
68|47|or have they knowledge of the unseen so they write it down
68|48|then be patient for the decision of your lord o muhammad and be not like the companion of the fish when he called out while he was distressed
68|49|if not that a favor from his lord overtook him he would have been thrown onto the naked shore while he was censured
68|50|and his lord chose him and made him of the righteous
68|51|and indeed those who disbelieve would almost make you slip with their eyes when they hear the message and they say indeed he is mad
68|52|but it is not except a reminder to the worlds
69|1|the inevitable reality
69|2|what is the inevitable reality
69|3|and what can make you know what is the inevitable reality
69|4|thamud and aad denied the striking calamity
69|5|so as for thamud they were destroyed by the overpowering blast
69|6|and as for aad they were destroyed by a screaming violent wind
69|7|which allah imposed upon them for seven nights and eight days in succession so you would see the people therein fallen as if they were hollow trunks of palm trees
69|8|then do you see of them any remains
69|9|and there came pharaoh and those before him and the overturned cities with sin
69|10|and they disobeyed the messenger of their lord so he seized them with a seizure exceeding in severity
69|11|indeed when the water overflowed we carried your ancestors in the sailing ship
69|12|that we might make it for you a reminder and that a conscious ear would be conscious of it
69|13|then when the horn is blown with one blast
69|14|and the earth and the mountains are lifted and leveled with one blow
69|15|then on that day the resurrection will occur
69|16|and the heaven will split open for that day it is infirm
69|17|and the angels are at its edges and there will bear the throne of your lord above them that day eight of them
69|18|that day you will be exhibited for judgement not hidden among you is anything concealed
69|19|so as for he who is given his record in his right hand he will say here read my record
69|20|indeed i was certain that i would be meeting my account
69|21|so he will be in a pleasant life
69|22|in an elevated garden
69|23|its fruit to be picked hanging near
69|24|they will be told eat and drink in satisfaction for what you put forth in the days past
69|25|but as for he who is given his record in his left hand he will say oh i wish i had not been given my record
69|26|and had not known what is my account
69|27|i wish my death had been the decisive one
69|28|my wealth has not availed me
69|29|gone from me is my authority
69|30|allah will say seize him and shackle him
69|31|then into hellfire drive him
69|32|then into a chain whose length is seventy cubits insert him
69|33|indeed he did not used to believe in allah the most great
69|34|nor did he encourage the feeding of the poor
69|35|so there is not for him here this day any devoted friend
69|36|nor any food except from the discharge of wounds
69|37|none will eat it except the sinners
69|38|so i swear by what you see
69|39|and what you do not see
69|40|that indeed the qur an is the word of a noble messenger
69|41|and it is not the word of a poet little do you believe
69|42|nor the word of a soothsayer little do you remember
69|43|it is a revelation from the lord of the worlds
69|44|and if muhammad had made up about us some false sayings
69|45|we would have seized him by the right hand
69|46|then we would have cut from him the aorta
69|47|and there is no one of you who could prevent us from him
69|48|and indeed the qur an is a reminder for the righteous
69|49|and indeed we know that among you are deniers
69|50|and indeed it will be a cause of regret upon the disbelievers
69|51|and indeed it is the truth of certainty
69|52|so exalt the name of your lord the most great
70|1|a supplicant asked for a punishment bound to happen
70|2|to the disbelievers of it there is no preventer
70|3|it is from allah owner of the ways of ascent
70|4|the angels and the spirit will ascend to him during a day the extent of which is fifty thousand years
70|5|so be patient with gracious patience
70|6|indeed they see it as distant
70|7|but we see it as near
70|8|on the day the sky will be like murky oil
70|9|and the mountains will be like wool
70|10|and no friend will ask anything of a friend
70|11|they will be shown each other the criminal will wish that he could be ransomed from the punishment of that day by his children
70|12|and his wife and his brother
70|13|and his nearest kindred who shelter him
70|14|and whoever is on earth entirely so then it could save him
70|15|no indeed it is the flame of hell
70|16|a remover of exteriors
70|17|it invites he who turned his back on truth and went away from obedience
70|18|and collected wealth and hoarded
70|19|indeed mankind was created anxious
70|20|when evil touches him impatient
70|21|and when good touches him withholding of it
70|22|except the observers of prayer
70|23|those who are constant in their prayer
70|24|and those within whose wealth is a known right
70|25|for the petitioner and the deprived
70|26|and those who believe in the day of recompense
70|27|and those who are fearful of the punishment of their lord
70|28|indeed the punishment of their lord is not that from which one is safe
70|29|and those who guard their private parts
70|30|except from their wives or those their right hands possess for indeed they are not to be blamed
70|31|but whoever seeks beyond that then they are the transgressors
70|32|and those who are to their trusts and promises attentive
70|33|and those who are in their testimonies upright
70|34|and those who carefully maintain their prayer
70|35|they will be in gardens honored
70|36|so what is the matter with those who disbelieve hastening from before you o muhammad
70|37|to sit on your right and your left in separate groups
70|38|does every person among them aspire to enter a garden of pleasure
70|39|no indeed we have created them from that which they know
70|40|so i swear by the lord of all risings and settings that indeed we are able
70|41|to replace them with better than them and we are not to be outdone
70|42|so leave them to converse vainly and amuse themselves until they meet their day which they are promised
70|43|the day they will emerge from the graves rapidly as if they were toward an erected idol hastening
70|44|their eyes humbled humiliation will cover them that is the day which they had been promised
71|1|indeed we sent noah to his people saying warn your people before there comes to them a painful punishment
71|2|he said o my people indeed i am to you a clear warner
71|3|saying worship allah fear him and obey me
71|4|allah will forgive you of your sins and delay you for a specified term indeed the time set by allah when it comes will not be delayed if you only knew
71|5|he said my lord indeed i invited my people to truth night and day
71|6|but my invitation increased them not except in flight
71|7|and indeed every time i invited them that you may forgive them they put their fingers in their ears covered themselves with their garments persisted and were arrogant with great arrogance
71|8|then i invited them publicly
71|9|then i announced to them and also confided to them secretly
71|10|and said ask forgiveness of your lord indeed he is ever a perpetual forgiver
71|11|he will send rain from the sky upon you in continuing showers
71|12|and give you increase in wealth and children and provide for you gardens and provide for you rivers
71|13|what is the matter with you that you do not attribute to allah due grandeur
71|14|while he has created you in stages
71|15|do you not consider how allah has created seven heavens in layers
71|16|and made the moon therein a reflected light and made the sun a burning lamp
71|17|and allah has caused you to grow from the earth a progressive growth
71|18|then he will return you into it and extract you another extraction
71|19|and allah has made for you the earth an expanse
71|20|that you may follow therein roads of passage
71|21|noah said my lord indeed they have disobeyed me and followed him whose wealth and children will not increase him except in loss
71|22|and they conspired an immense conspiracy
71|23|and said never leave your gods and never leave wadd or suwa or yaghuth and ya uq and nasr
71|24|and already they have misled many and my lord do not increase the wrongdoers except in error
71|25|because of their sins they were drowned and put into the fire and they found not for themselves besides allah any helpers
71|26|and noah said my lord do not leave upon the earth from among the disbelievers an inhabitant
71|27|indeed if you leave them they will mislead your servants and not beget except every wicked one and confirmed disbeliever
71|28|my lord forgive me and my parents and whoever enters my house a believer and the believing men and believing women and do not increase the wrongdoers except in destruction
72|1|say o muhammad it has been revealed to me that a group of the jinn listened and said indeed we have heard an amazing qur an
72|2|it guides to the right course and we have believed in it and we will never associate with our lord anyone
72|3|and it teaches that exalted is the nobleness of our lord he has not taken a wife or a son
72|4|and that our foolish one has been saying about allah an excessive transgression
72|5|and we had thought that mankind and the jinn would never speak about allah a lie
72|6|and there were men from mankind who sought refuge in men from the jinn so they only increased them in burden
72|7|and they had thought as you thought that allah would never send anyone as a messenger
72|8|and we have sought to reach the heaven but found it filled with powerful guards and burning flames
72|9|and we used to sit therein in positions for hearing but whoever listens now will find a burning flame lying in wait for him
72|10|and we do not know therefore whether evil is intended for those on earth or whether their lord intends for them a right course
72|11|and among us are the righteous and among us are others not so we were of divided ways
72|12|and we have become certain that we will never cause failure to allah upon earth nor can we escape him by flight
72|13|and when we heard the guidance we believed in it and whoever believes in his lord will not fear deprivation or burden
72|14|and among us are muslims in submission to allah and among us are the unjust and whoever has become muslim those have sought out the right course
72|15|but as for the unjust they will be for hell firewood
72|16|and allah revealed that if they had remained straight on the way we would have given them abundant provision
72|17|so we might test them therein and whoever turns away from the remembrance of his lord he will put into arduous punishment
72|18|and he revealed that the masjids are for allah so do not invoke with allah anyone
72|19|and that when the servant of allah stood up supplicating him they almost became about him a compacted mass
72|20|say o muhammad i only invoke my lord and do not associate with him anyone
72|21|say indeed i do not possess for you the power of harm or right direction
72|22|say indeed there will never protect me from allah anyone if i should disobey nor will i find in other than him a refuge
72|23|but i have for you only notification from allah and his messages and whoever disobeys allah and his messenger then indeed for him is the fire of hell they will abide therein forever
72|24|the disbelievers continue until when they see that which they are promised then they will know who is weaker in helpers and less in number
72|25|say i do not know if what you are promised is near or if my lord will grant for it a long period
72|26|he is knower of the unseen and he does not disclose his knowledge of the unseen to anyone
72|27|except whom he has approved of messengers and indeed he sends before each messenger and behind him observers
72|28|that he may know that they have conveyed the messages of their lord and he has encompassed whatever is with them and has enumerated all things in number
73|1|o you who wraps himself in clothing
73|2|arise to pray the night except for a little
73|3|half of it or subtract from it a little
73|4|or add to it and recite the qur an with measured recitation
73|5|indeed we will cast upon you a heavy word
73|6|indeed the hours of the night are more effective for concurrence of heart and tongue and more suitable for words
73|7|indeed for you by day is prolonged occupation
73|8|and remember the name of your lord and devote yourself to him with complete devotion
73|9|he is the lord of the east and the west there is no deity except him so take him as disposer of your affairs
73|10|and be patient over what they say and avoid them with gracious avoidance
73|11|and leave me with the matter of the deniers those of ease in life and allow them respite a little
73|12|indeed with us for them are shackles and burning fire
73|13|and food that chokes and a painful punishment
73|14|on the day the earth and the mountains will convulse and the mountains will become a heap of sand pouring down
73|15|indeed we have sent to you a messenger as a witness upon you just as we sent to pharaoh a messenger
73|16|but pharaoh disobeyed the messenger so we seized him with a ruinous seizure
73|17|then how can you fear if you disbelieve a day that will make the children white haired
73|18|the heaven will break apart therefrom ever is his promise fulfilled
73|19|indeed this is a reminder so whoever wills may take to his lord a way
73|20|indeed your lord knows o muhammad that you stand in prayer almost two thirds of the night or half of it or a third of it and so do a group of those with you and allah determines the extent of the night and the day he has known that you muslims will not be able to do it and has turned to you in forgiveness so recite what is easy for you of the qur an he has known that there will be among you those who are ill and others traveling throughout the land seeking something of the bounty of allah and others fighting for the cause of allah so recite what is easy from it and establish prayer and give zakah and loan allah a goodly loan and whatever good you put forward for yourselves you will find it with allah it is better and greater in reward and seek forgiveness of allah indeed allah is forgiving and merciful
74|1|o you who covers himself with a garment
74|2|arise and warn
74|3|and your lord glorify
74|4|and your clothing purify
74|5|and uncleanliness avoid
74|6|and do not confer favor to acquire more
74|7|but for your lord be patient
74|8|and when the trumpet is blown
74|9|that day will be a difficult day
74|10|for the disbelievers not easy
74|11|leave me with the one i created alone
74|12|and to whom i granted extensive wealth
74|13|and children present with him
74|14|and spread everything before him easing his life
74|15|then he desires that i should add more
74|16|no indeed he has been toward our verses obstinate
74|17|i will cover him with arduous torment
74|18|indeed he thought and deliberated
74|19|so may he be destroyed for how he deliberated
74|20|then may he be destroyed for how he deliberated
74|21|then he considered again
74|22|then he frowned and scowled
74|23|then he turned back and was arrogant
74|24|and said this is not but magic imitated from others
74|25|this is not but the word of a human being
74|26|i will drive him into saqar
74|27|and what can make you know what is saqar
74|28|it lets nothing remain and leaves nothing unburned
74|29|blackening the skins
74|30|over it are nineteen angels
74|31|and we have not made the keepers of the fire except angels and we have not made their number except as a trial for those who disbelieve that those who were given the scripture will be convinced and those who have believed will increase in faith and those who were given the scripture and the believers will not doubt and that those in whose hearts is hypocrisy and the disbelievers will say what does allah intend by this as an example thus does allah leave astray whom he wills and guides whom he wills and none knows the soldiers of your lord except him and mention of the fire is not but a reminder to humanity
74|32|no by the moon
74|33|and by the night when it departs
74|34|and by the morning when it brightens
74|35|indeed the fire is of the greatest afflictions
74|36|as a warning to humanity
74|37|to whoever wills among you to proceed or stay behind
74|38|every soul for what it has earned will be retained
74|39|except the companions of the right
74|40|who will be in gardens questioning each other
74|41|about the criminals
74|42|and asking them what put you into saqar
74|43|they will say we were not of those who prayed
74|44|nor did we used to feed the poor
74|45|and we used to enter into vain discourse with those who engaged in it
74|46|and we used to deny the day of recompense
74|47|until there came to us the certainty
74|48|so there will not benefit them the intercession of any intercessors
74|49|then what is the matter with them that they are from the reminder turning away
74|50|as if they were alarmed donkeys
74|51|fleeing from a lion
74|52|rather every person among them desires that he would be given scriptures spread about
74|53|no but they do not fear the hereafter
74|54|no indeed the qur an is a reminder
74|55|then whoever wills will remember it
74|56|and they will not remember except that allah wills he is worthy of fear and adequate for granting forgiveness
75|1|i swear by the day of resurrection
75|2|and i swear by the reproaching soul to the certainty of resurrection
75|3|does man think that we will not assemble his bones
75|4|yes we are able even to proportion his fingertips
75|5|but man desires to continue in sin
75|6|he asks when is the day of resurrection
75|7|so when vision is dazzled
75|8|and the moon darkens
75|9|and the sun and the moon are joined
75|10|man will say on that day where is the place of escape
75|11|no there is no refuge
75|12|to your lord that day is the place of permanence
75|13|man will be informed that day of what he sent ahead and kept back
75|14|rather man against himself will be a witness
75|15|even if he presents his excuses
75|16|move not your tongue with it o muhammad to hasten with recitation of the qur an
75|17|indeed upon us is its collection in your heart and to make possible its recitation
75|18|so when we have recited it through gabriel then follow its recitation
75|19|then upon us is its clarification to you
75|20|no but you love the immediate
75|21|and leave the hereafter
75|22|some faces that day will be radiant
75|23|looking at their lord
75|24|and some faces that day will be contorted
75|25|expecting that there will be done to them something backbreaking
75|26|no when the soul has reached the collar bones
75|27|and it is said who will cure him
75|28|and the dying one is certain that it is the time of separation
75|29|and the leg is wound about the leg
75|30|to your lord that day will be the procession
75|31|and the disbeliever had not believed nor had he prayed
75|32|but instead he denied and turned away
75|33|and then he went to his people swaggering in pride
75|34|woe to you and woe
75|35|then woe to you and woe
75|36|does man think that he will be left neglected
75|37|had he not been a sperm from semen emitted
75|38|then he was a clinging clot and allah created his form and proportioned him
75|39|and made of him two mates the male and the female
75|40|is not that creator able to give life to the dead
76|1|has there not come upon man a period of time when he was not a thing even mentioned
76|2|indeed we created man from a sperm drop mixture that we may try him and we made him hearing and seeing
76|3|indeed we guided him to the way be he grateful or be he ungrateful
76|4|indeed we have prepared for the disbelievers chains and shackles and a blaze
76|5|indeed the righteous will drink from a cup of wine whose mixture is of kafur
76|6|a spring of which the righteous servants of allah will drink they will make it gush forth in force and abundance
76|7|they are those who fulfill their vows and fear a day whose evil will be widespread
76|8|and they give food in spite of love for it to the needy the orphan and the captive
76|9|saying we feed you only for the countenance of allah we wish not from you reward or gratitude
76|10|indeed we fear from our lord a day austere and distressful
76|11|so allah will protect them from the evil of that day and give them radiance and happiness
76|12|and will reward them for what they patiently endured with a garden in paradise and silk garments
76|13|they will be reclining therein on adorned couches they will not see therein any burning sun or freezing cold
76|14|and near above them are its shades and its fruit to be picked will be lowered in compliance
76|15|and there will be circulated among them vessels of silver and cups having been created clear as glass
76|16|clear glasses made from silver of which they have determined the measure
76|17|and they will be given to drink a cup of wine whose mixture is of ginger
76|18|from a fountain within paradise named salsabeel
76|19|there will circulate among them young boys made eternal when you see them you would think them as beautiful as scattered pearls
76|20|and when you look there in paradise you will see pleasure and great dominion
76|21|upon the inhabitants will be green garments of fine silk and brocade and they will be adorned with bracelets of silver and their lord will give them a purifying drink
76|22|and it will be said indeed this is for you a reward and your effort has been appreciated
76|23|indeed it is we who have sent down to you o muhammad the qur an progressively
76|24|so be patient for the decision of your lord and do not obey from among them a sinner or ungrateful disbeliever
76|25|and mention the name of your lord in prayer morning and evening
76|26|and during the night prostrate to him and exalt him a long part of the night
76|27|indeed these disbelievers love the immediate and leave behind them a grave day
76|28|we have created them and strengthened their forms and when we will we can change their likenesses with complete alteration
76|29|indeed this is a reminder so he who wills may take to his lord a way
76|30|and you do not will except that allah wills indeed allah is ever knowing and wise
76|31|he admits whom he wills into his mercy but the wrongdoers he has prepared for them a painful punishment
77|1|by those winds sent forth in gusts
77|2|and the winds that blow violently
77|3|and by the winds that spread clouds
77|4|and those angels who bring criterion
77|5|and those angels who deliver a message
77|6|as justification or warning
77|7|indeed what you are promised is to occur
77|8|so when the stars are obliterated
77|9|and when the heaven is opened
77|10|and when the mountains are blown away
77|11|and when the messengers time has come
77|12|for what day was it postponed
77|13|for the day of judgement
77|14|and what can make you know what is the day of judgement
77|15|woe that day to the deniers
77|16|did we not destroy the former peoples
77|17|then we will follow them with the later ones
77|18|thus do we deal with the criminals
77|19|woe that day to the deniers
77|20|did we not create you from a liquid disdained
77|21|and we placed it in a firm lodging
77|22|for a known extent
77|23|and we determined it and excellent are we to determine
77|24|woe that day to the deniers
77|25|have we not made the earth a container
77|26|of the living and the dead
77|27|and we placed therein lofty firmly set mountains and have given you to drink sweet water
77|28|woe that day to the deniers
77|29|they will be told proceed to that which you used to deny
77|30|proceed to a shadow of smoke having three columns
77|31|but having no cool shade and availing not against the flame
77|32|indeed it throws sparks as huge as a fortress
77|33|as if they were yellowish black camels
77|34|woe that day to the deniers
77|35|this is a day they will not speak
77|36|nor will it be permitted for them to make an excuse
77|37|woe that day to the deniers
77|38|this is the day of judgement we will have assembled you and the former peoples
77|39|so if you have a plan then plan against me
77|40|woe that day to the deniers
77|41|indeed the righteous will be among shades and springs
77|42|and fruits from whatever they desire
77|43|being told eat and drink in satisfaction for what you used to do
77|44|indeed we thus reward the doers of good
77|45|woe that day to the deniers
77|46|o disbelievers eat and enjoy yourselves a little indeed you are criminals
77|47|woe that day to the deniers
77|48|and when it is said to them bow in prayer they do not bow
77|49|woe that day to the deniers
77|50|then in what statement after the qur an will they believe
78|1|about what are they asking one another
78|2|about the great news
78|3|that over which they are in disagreement
78|4|no they are going to know
78|5|then no they are going to know
78|6|have we not made the earth a resting place
78|7|and the mountains as stakes
78|8|and we created you in pairs
78|9|and made your sleep a means for rest
78|10|and made the night as clothing
78|11|and made the day for livelihood
78|12|and constructed above you seven strong heavens
78|13|and made therein a burning lamp
78|14|and sent down from the rain clouds pouring water
78|15|that we may bring forth thereby grain and vegetation
78|16|and gardens of entwined growth
78|17|indeed the day of judgement is an appointed time
78|18|the day the horn is blown and you will come forth in multitudes
78|19|and the heaven is opened and will become gateways
78|20|and the mountains are removed and will be but a mirage
78|21|indeed hell has been lying in wait
78|22|for the transgressors a place of return
78|23|in which they will remain for ages unending
78|24|they will not taste therein any coolness or drink
78|25|except scalding water and foul purulence
78|26|an appropriate recompense
78|27|indeed they were not expecting an account
78|28|and denied our verses with emphatic denial
78|29|but all things we have enumerated in writing
78|30|so taste the penalty and never will we increase you except in torment
78|31|indeed for the righteous is attainment
78|32|gardens and grapevines
78|33|and full breasted companions of equal age
78|34|and a full cup
78|35|no ill speech will they hear therein or any falsehood
78|36|as reward from your lord a generous gift made due by account
78|37|from the lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them the most merciful they possess not from him authority for speech
78|38|the day that the spirit and the angels will stand in rows they will not speak except for one whom the most merciful permits and he will say what is correct
78|39|that is the true day so he who wills may take to his lord a way of return
78|40|indeed we have warned you of a near punishment on the day when a man will observe what his hands have put forth and the disbeliever will say oh i wish that i were dust
79|1|by those angels who extract with violence
79|2|and by those who remove with ease
79|3|and by those who glide as if swimming
79|4|and those who race each other in a race
79|5|and those who arrange each matter
79|6|on the day the blast of the horn will convulse creation
79|7|there will follow it the subsequent one
79|8|hearts that day will tremble
79|9|their eyes humbled
79|10|they are presently saying will we indeed be returned to our former state of life
79|11|even if we should be decayed bones
79|12|they say that then would be a losing return
79|13|indeed it will be but one shout
79|14|and suddenly they will be alert upon the earth s surface
79|15|has there reached you the story of moses
79|16|when his lord called to him in the sacred valley of tuwa
79|17|go to pharaoh indeed he has transgressed
79|18|and say to him would you be willing to purify yourself
79|19|and let me guide you to your lord so you would fear him
79|20|and he showed him the greatest sign
79|21|but pharaoh denied and disobeyed
79|22|then he turned his back striving
79|23|and he gathered his people and called out
79|24|and said i am your most exalted lord
79|25|so allah seized him in exemplary punishment for the last and the first transgression
79|26|indeed in that is a warning for whoever would fear allah
79|27|are you a more difficult creation or is the heaven allah constructed it
79|28|he raised its ceiling and proportioned it
79|29|and he darkened its night and extracted its brightness
79|30|and after that he spread the earth
79|31|he extracted from it its water and its pasture
79|32|and the mountains he set firmly
79|33|as provision for you and your grazing livestock
79|34|but when there comes the greatest overwhelming calamity
79|35|the day when man will remember that for which he strove
79|36|and hellfire will be exposed for all those who see
79|37|so as for he who transgressed
79|38|and preferred the life of the world
79|39|then indeed hellfire will be his refuge
79|40|but as for he who feared the position of his lord and prevented the soul from unlawful inclination
79|41|then indeed paradise will be his refuge
79|42|they ask you o muhammad about the hour when is its arrival
79|43|in what position are you that you should mention it
79|44|to your lord is its finality
79|45|you are only a warner for those who fear it
79|46|it will be on the day they see it as though they had not remained in the world except for an afternoon or a morning thereof
80|1|the prophet frowned and turned away
80|2|because there came to him the blind man interrupting
80|3|but what would make you perceive o muhammad that perhaps he might be purified
80|4|or be reminded and the remembrance would benefit him
80|5|as for he who thinks himself without need
80|6|to him you give attention
80|7|and not upon you is any blame if he will not be purified
80|8|but as for he who came to you striving for knowledge
80|9|while he fears allah
80|10|from him you are distracted
80|11|no indeed these verses are a reminder
80|12|so whoever wills may remember it
80|13|it is recorded in honored sheets
80|14|exalted and purified
80|15|carried by the hands of messenger angels
80|16|noble and dutiful
80|17|cursed is man how disbelieving is he
80|18|from what substance did he create him
80|19|from a sperm drop he created him and destined for him
80|20|then he eased the way for him
80|21|then he causes his death and provides a grave for him
80|22|then when he wills he will resurrect him
80|23|no man has not yet accomplished what he commanded him
80|24|then let mankind look at his food
80|25|how we poured down water in torrents
80|26|then we broke open the earth splitting it with sprouts
80|27|and caused to grow within it grain
80|28|and grapes and herbage
80|29|and olive and palm trees
80|30|and gardens of dense shrubbery
80|31|and fruit and grass
80|32|as enjoyment for you and your grazing livestock
80|33|but when there comes the deafening blast
80|34|on the day a man will flee from his brother
80|35|and his mother and his father
80|36|and his wife and his children
80|37|for every man that day will be a matter adequate for him
80|38|some faces that day will be bright
80|39|laughing rejoicing at good news
80|40|and other faces that day will have upon them dust
80|41|blackness will cover them
80|42|those are the disbelievers the wicked ones
81|1|when the sun is wrapped up in darkness
81|2|and when the stars fall dispersing
81|3|and when the mountains are removed
81|4|and when full term she camels are neglected
81|5|and when the wild beasts are gathered
81|6|and when the seas are filled with flame
81|7|and when the souls are paired
81|8|and when the girl who was buried alive is asked
81|9|for what sin she was killed
81|10|and when the pages are made public
81|11|and when the sky is stripped away
81|12|and when hellfire is set ablaze
81|13|and when paradise is brought near
81|14|a soul will then know what it has brought with it
81|15|so i swear by the retreating stars
81|16|those that run their courses and disappear
81|17|and by the night as it closes in
81|18|and by the dawn when it breathes
81|19|that indeed the qur an is a word conveyed by a noble messenger
81|20|who is possessed of power and with the owner of the throne secure in position
81|21|obeyed there in the heavens and trustworthy
81|22|and your companion is not at all mad
81|23|and he has already seen gabriel in the clear horizon
81|24|and muhammad is not a withholder of knowledge of the unseen
81|25|and the qur an is not the word of a devil expelled from the heavens
81|26|so where are you going
81|27|it is not except a reminder to the worlds
81|28|for whoever wills among you to take a right course
81|29|and you do not will except that allah wills lord of the worlds
82|1|when the sky breaks apart
82|2|and when the stars fall scattering
82|3|and when the seas are erupted
82|4|and when the contents of graves are scattered
82|5|a soul will then know what it has put forth and kept back
82|6|o mankind what has deceived you concerning your lord the generous
82|7|who created you proportioned you and balanced you
82|8|in whatever form he willed has he assembled you
82|9|no but you deny the recompense
82|10|and indeed appointed over you are keepers
82|11|noble and recording
82|12|they know whatever you do
82|13|indeed the righteous will be in pleasure
82|14|and indeed the wicked will be in hellfire
82|15|they will enter to burn therein on the day of recompense
82|16|and never therefrom will they be absent
82|17|and what can make you know what is the day of recompense
82|18|then what can make you know what is the day of recompense
82|19|it is the day when a soul will not possess for another soul power to do a thing and the command that day is entirely with allah
83|1|woe to those who give less than due
83|2|who when they take a measure from people take in full
83|3|but if they give by measure or by weight to them they cause loss
83|4|do they not think that they will be resurrected
83|5|for a tremendous day
83|6|the day when mankind will stand before the lord of the worlds
83|7|no indeed the record of the wicked is in sijjeen
83|8|and what can make you know what is sijjeen
83|9|it is their destination recorded in a register inscribed
83|10|woe that day to the deniers
83|11|who deny the day of recompense
83|12|and none deny it except every sinful transgressor
83|13|when our verses are recited to him he says legends of the former peoples
83|14|no rather the stain has covered their hearts of that which they were earning
83|15|no indeed from their lord that day they will be partitioned
83|16|then indeed they will enter and burn in hellfire
83|17|then it will be said to them this is what you used to deny
83|18|no indeed the record of the righteous is in illiyyun
83|19|and what can make you know what is illiyyun
83|20|it is their destination recorded in a register inscribed
83|21|which is witnessed by those brought near to allah
83|22|indeed the righteous will be in pleasure
83|23|on adorned couches observing
83|24|you will recognize in their faces the radiance of pleasure
83|25|they will be given to drink pure wine which was sealed
83|26|the last of it is musk so for this let the competitors compete
83|27|and its mixture is of tasneem
83|28|a spring from which those near to allah drink
83|29|indeed those who committed crimes used to laugh at those who believed
83|30|and when they passed by them they would exchange derisive glances
83|31|and when they returned to their people they would return jesting
83|32|and when they saw them they would say indeed those are truly lost
83|33|but they had not been sent as guardians over them
83|34|so today those who believed are laughing at the disbelievers
83|35|on adorned couches observing
83|36|have the disbelievers not been rewarded this day for what they used to do
84|1|when the sky has split open
84|2|and has responded to its lord and was obligated to do so
84|3|and when the earth has been extended
84|4|and has cast out that within it and relinquished it
84|5|and has responded to its lord and was obligated to do so
84|6|o mankind indeed you are laboring toward your lord with great exertion and will meet it
84|7|then as for he who is given his record in his right hand
84|8|he will be judged with an easy account
84|9|and return to his people in happiness
84|10|but as for he who is given his record behind his back
84|11|he will cry out for destruction
84|12|and enter to burn in a blaze
84|13|indeed he had once been among his people in happiness
84|14|indeed he had thought he would never return to allah
84|15|but yes indeed his lord was ever of him seeing
84|16|so i swear by the twilight glow
84|17|and by the night and what it envelops
84|18|and by the moon when it becomes full
84|19|that you will surely experience state after state
84|20|so what is the matter with them that they do not believe
84|21|and when the qur an is recited to them they do not prostrate to allah
84|22|but those who have disbelieved deny
84|23|and allah is most knowing of what they keep within themselves
84|24|so give them tidings of a painful punishment
84|25|except for those who believe and do righteous deeds for them is a reward uninterrupted
85|1|by the sky containing great stars
85|2|and by the promised day
85|3|and by the witness and what is witnessed
85|4|cursed were the companions of the trench
85|5|containing the fire full of fuel
85|6|when they were sitting near it
85|7|and they to what they were doing against the believers were witnesses
85|8|and they resented them not except because they believed in allah the exalted in might the praiseworthy
85|9|to whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and allah over all things is witness
85|10|indeed those who have tortured the believing men and believing women and then have not repented will have the punishment of hell and they will have the punishment of the burning fire
85|11|indeed those who have believed and done righteous deeds will have gardens beneath which rivers flow that is the great attainment
85|12|indeed the vengeance of your lord is severe
85|13|indeed it is he who originates creation and repeats
85|14|and he is the forgiving the affectionate
85|15|honorable owner of the throne
85|16|effecter of what he intends
85|17|has there reached you the story of the soldiers
85|18|those of pharaoh and thamud
85|19|but they who disbelieve are in persistent denial
85|20|while allah encompasses them from behind
85|21|but this is an honored qur an
85|22|inscribed in a preserved slate
86|1|by the sky and the night comer
86|2|and what can make you know what is the night comer
86|3|it is the piercing star
86|4|there is no soul but that it has over it a protector
86|5|so let man observe from what he was created
86|6|he was created from a fluid ejected
86|7|emerging from between the backbone and the ribs
86|8|indeed allah to return him to life is able
86|9|the day when secrets will be put on trial
86|10|then man will have no power or any helper
86|11|by the sky which returns rain
86|12|and by the earth which cracks open
86|13|indeed the qur an is a decisive statement
86|14|and it is not amusement
86|15|indeed they are planning a plan
86|16|but i am planning a plan
86|17|so allow time for the disbelievers leave them awhile
87|1|exalt the name of your lord the most high
87|2|who created and proportioned
87|3|and who destined and then guided
87|4|and who brings out the pasture
87|5|and then makes it black stubble
87|6|we will make you recite o muhammad and you will not forget
87|7|except what allah should will indeed he knows what is declared and what is hidden
87|8|and we will ease you toward ease
87|9|so remind if the reminder should benefit
87|10|he who fears allah will be reminded
87|11|but the wretched one will avoid it
87|12|he who will enter and burn in the greatest fire
87|13|neither dying therein nor living
87|14|he has certainly succeeded who purifies himself
87|15|and mentions the name of his lord and prays
87|16|but you prefer the worldly life
87|17|while the hereafter is better and more enduring
87|18|indeed this is in the former scriptures
87|19|the scriptures of abraham and moses
88|1|has there reached you the report of the overwhelming event
88|2|some faces that day will be humbled
88|3|working hard and exhausted
88|4|they will enter to burn in an intensely hot fire
88|5|they will be given drink from a boiling spring
88|6|for them there will be no food except from a poisonous thorny plant
88|7|which neither nourishes nor avails against hunger
88|8|other faces that day will show pleasure
88|9|with their effort they are satisfied
88|10|in an elevated garden
88|11|wherein they will hear no unsuitable speech
88|12|within it is a flowing spring
88|13|within it are couches raised high
88|14|and cups put in place
88|15|and cushions lined up
88|16|and carpets spread around
88|17|then do they not look at the camels how they are created
88|18|and at the sky how it is raised
88|19|and at the mountains how they are erected
88|20|and at the earth how it is spread out
88|21|so remind o muhammad you are only a reminder
88|22|you are not over them a controller
88|23|however he who turns away and disbelieves
88|24|then allah will punish him with the greatest punishment
88|25|indeed to us is their return
88|26|then indeed upon us is their account
89|1|by the dawn
89|2|and by ten nights
89|3|and by the even number and the odd
89|4|and by the night when it passes
89|5|is there not in all that an oath sufficient for one of perception
89|6|have you not considered how your lord dealt with aad
89|7|with iram who had lofty pillars
89|8|the likes of whom had never been created in the land
89|9|and with thamud who carved out the rocks in the valley
89|10|and with pharaoh owner of the stakes
89|11|all of whom oppressed within the lands
89|12|and increased therein the corruption
89|13|so your lord poured upon them a scourge of punishment
89|14|indeed your lord is in observation
89|15|and as for man when his lord tries him and thus is generous to him and favors him he says my lord has honored me
89|16|but when he tries him and restricts his provision he says my lord has humiliated me
89|17|no but you do not honor the orphan
89|18|and you do not encourage one another to feed the poor
89|19|and you consume inheritance devouring it altogether
89|20|and you love wealth with immense love
89|21|no when the earth has been leveled pounded and crushed
89|22|and your lord has come and the angels rank upon rank
89|23|and brought within view that day is hell that day man will remember but what good to him will be the remembrance
89|24|he will say oh i wish i had sent ahead some good for my life
89|25|so on that day none will punish as severely as his punishment
89|26|and none will bind as severely as his binding of the evildoers
89|27|to the righteous it will be said o reassured soul
89|28|return to your lord well pleased and pleasing to him
89|29|and enter among my righteous servants
89|30|and enter my paradise
90|1|i swear by this city makkah
90|2|and you o muhammad are free of restriction in this city
90|3|and by the father and that which was born of him
90|4|we have certainly created man into hardship
90|5|does he think that never will anyone overcome him
90|6|he says i have spent wealth in abundance
90|7|does he think that no one has seen him
90|8|have we not made for him two eyes
90|9|and a tongue and two lips
90|10|and have shown him the two ways
90|11|but he has not broken through the difficult pass
90|12|and what can make you know what is breaking through the difficult pass
90|13|it is the freeing of a slave
90|14|or feeding on a day of severe hunger
90|15|an orphan of near relationship
90|16|or a needy person in misery
90|17|and then being among those who believed and advised one another to patience and advised one another to compassion
90|18|those are the companions of the right
90|19|but they who disbelieved in our signs those are the companions of the left
90|20|over them will be fire closed in
91|1|by the sun and its brightness
91|2|and by the moon when it follows it
91|3|and by the day when it displays it
91|4|and by the night when it covers it
91|5|and by the sky and he who constructed it
91|6|and by the earth and he who spread it
91|7|and by the soul and he who proportioned it
91|8|and inspired it with discernment of its wickedness and its righteousness
91|9|he has succeeded who purifies it
91|10|and he has failed who instills it with corruption
91|11|thamud denied their prophet by reason of their transgression
91|12|when the most wretched of them was sent forth
91|13|and the messenger of allah salih said to them do not harm the she camel of allah or prevent her from her drink
91|14|but they denied him and hamstrung her so their lord brought down upon them destruction for their sin and made it equal upon all of them
91|15|and he does not fear the consequence thereof
92|1|by the night when it covers
92|2|and by the day when it appears
92|3|and by he who created the male and female
92|4|indeed your efforts are diverse
92|5|as for he who gives and fears allah
92|6|and believes in the best reward
92|7|we will ease him toward ease
92|8|but as for he who withholds and considers himself free of need
92|9|and denies the best reward
92|10|we will ease him toward difficulty
92|11|and what will his wealth avail him when he falls
92|12|indeed incumbent upon us is guidance
92|13|and indeed to us belongs the hereafter and the first life
92|14|so i have warned you of a fire which is blazing
92|15|none will enter to burn therein except the most wretched one
92|16|who had denied and turned away
92|17|but the righteous one will avoid it
92|18|he who gives from his wealth to purify himself
92|19|and not giving for anyone who has done him a favor to be rewarded
92|20|but only seeking the countenance of his lord most high
92|21|and he is going to be satisfied
93|1|by the morning brightness
93|2|and by the night when it covers with darkness
93|3|your lord has not taken leave of you o muhammad nor has he detested you
93|4|and the hereafter is better for you than the first life
93|5|and your lord is going to give you and you will be satisfied
93|6|did he not find you an orphan and give you refuge
93|7|and he found you lost and guided you
93|8|and he found you poor and made you self sufficient
93|9|so as for the orphan do not oppress him
93|10|and as for the petitioner do not repel him
93|11|but as for the favor of your lord report it
94|1|did we not expand for you o muhammad your breast
94|2|and we removed from you your burden
94|3|which had weighed upon your back
94|4|and raised high for you your repute
94|5|for indeed with hardship will be ease
94|6|indeed with hardship will be ease
94|7|so when you have finished your duties then stand up for worship
94|8|and to your lord direct your longing
95|1|by the fig and the olive
95|2|and by mount sinai
95|3|and by this secure city makkah
95|4|we have certainly created man in the best of stature
95|5|then we return him to the lowest of the low
95|6|except for those who believe and do righteous deeds for they will have a reward uninterrupted
95|7|so what yet causes you to deny the recompense
95|8|is not allah the most just of judges
96|1|recite in the name of your lord who created
96|2|created man from a clinging substance
96|3|recite and your lord is the most generous
96|4|who taught by the pen
96|5|taught man that which he knew not
96|6|no but indeed man transgresses
96|7|because he sees himself self sufficient
96|8|indeed to your lord is the return
96|9|have you seen the one who forbids
96|10|a servant when he prays
96|11|have you seen if he is upon guidance
96|12|or enjoins righteousness
96|13|have you seen if he denies and turns away
96|14|does he not know that allah sees
96|15|no if he does not desist we will surely drag him by the forelock
96|16|a lying sinning forelock
96|17|then let him call his associates
96|18|we will call the angels of hell
96|19|no do not obey him but prostrate and draw near to allah
97|1|indeed we sent the qur an down during the night of decree
97|2|and what can make you know what is the night of decree
97|3|the night of decree is better than a thousand months
97|4|the angels and the spirit descend therein by permission of their lord for every matter
97|5|peace it is until the emergence of dawn
98|1|those who disbelieved among the people of the scripture and the polytheists were not to be parted from misbelief until there came to them clear evidence
98|2|a messenger from allah reciting purified scriptures
98|3|within which are correct writings
98|4|nor did those who were given the scripture become divided until after there had come to them clear evidence
98|5|and they were not commanded except to worship allah being sincere to him in religion inclining to truth and to establish prayer and to give zakah and that is the correct religion
98|6|indeed they who disbelieved among the people of the scripture and the polytheists will be in the fire of hell abiding eternally therein those are the worst of creatures
98|7|indeed they who have believed and done righteous deeds those are the best of creatures
98|8|their reward with allah will be gardens of perpetual residence beneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide forever allah being pleased with them and they with him that is for whoever has feared his lord
99|1|when the earth is shaken with its final earthquake
99|2|and the earth discharges its burdens
99|3|and man says what is wrong with it
99|4|that day it will report its news
99|5|because your lord has commanded it
99|6|that day the people will depart separated into categories to be shown the result of their deeds
99|7|so whoever does an atom s weight of good will see it
99|8|and whoever does an atom s weight of evil will see it
100|1|by the racers panting
100|2|and the producers of sparks when striking
100|3|and the chargers at dawn
100|4|stirring up thereby clouds of dust
100|5|arriving thereby in the center collectively
100|6|indeed mankind to his lord is ungrateful
100|7|and indeed he is to that a witness
100|8|and indeed he is in love of wealth intense
100|9|but does he not know that when the contents of the graves are scattered
100|10|and that within the breasts is obtained
100|11|indeed their lord with them that day is fully acquainted
101|1|the striking calamity
101|2|what is the striking calamity
101|3|and what can make you know what is the striking calamity
101|4|it is the day when people will be like moths dispersed
101|5|and the mountains will be like wool fluffed up
101|6|then as for one whose scales are heavy with good deeds
101|7|he will be in a pleasant life
101|8|but as for one whose scales are light
101|9|his refuge will be an abyss
101|10|and what can make you know what that is
101|11|it is a fire intensely hot
102|1|competition in worldly increase diverts you
102|2|until you visit the graveyards
102|3|no you are going to know
102|4|then no you are going to know
102|5|no if you only knew with knowledge of certainty
102|6|you will surely see the hellfire
102|7|then you will surely see it with the eye of certainty
102|8|then you will surely be asked that day about pleasure
103|1|by time
103|2|indeed mankind is in loss
103|3|except for those who have believed and done righteous deeds and advised each other to truth and advised each other to patience
104|1|woe to every scorner and mocker
104|2|who collects wealth and continuously counts it
104|3|he thinks that his wealth will make him immortal
104|4|no he will surely be thrown into the crusher
104|5|and what can make you know what is the crusher
104|6|it is the fire of allah eternally fueled
104|7|which mounts directed at the hearts
104|8|indeed hellfire will be closed down upon them
104|9|in extended columns
105|1|have you not considered o muhammad how your lord dealt with the companions of the elephant
105|2|did he not make their plan into misguidance
105|3|and he sent against them birds in flocks
105|4|striking them with stones of hard clay
105|5|and he made them like eaten straw
106|1|for the accustomed security of the quraysh
106|2|their accustomed security in the caravan of winter and summer
106|3|let them worship the lord of this house
106|4|who has fed them saving them from hunger and made them safe saving them from fear
107|1|have you seen the one who denies the recompense
107|2|for that is the one who drives away the orphan
107|3|and does not encourage the feeding of the poor
107|4|so woe to those who pray
107|5|but who are heedless of their prayer
107|6|those who make show of their deeds
107|7|and withhold simple assistance
108|1|indeed we have granted you o muhammad al kawthar
108|2|so pray to your lord and sacrifice to him alone
108|3|indeed your enemy is the one cut off
109|1|say o disbelievers
109|2|i do not worship what you worship
109|3|nor are you worshippers of what i worship
109|4|nor will i be a worshipper of what you worship
109|5|nor will you be worshippers of what i worship
109|6|for you is your religion and for me is my religion
110|1|when the victory of allah has come and the conquest
110|2|and you see the people entering into the religion of allah in multitudes
110|3|then exalt him with praise of your lord and ask forgiveness of him indeed he is ever accepting of repentance
111|1|may the hands of abu lahab be ruined and ruined is he
111|2|his wealth will not avail him or that which he gained
111|3|he will enter to burn in a fire of blazing flame
111|4|and his wife as well the carrier of firewood
111|5|around her neck is a rope of twisted fiber
112|1|say he is allah who is one
112|2|allah the eternal refuge
112|3|he neither begets nor is born
112|4|nor is there to him any equivalent
113|1|say i seek refuge in the lord of daybreak
113|2|from the evil of that which he created
113|3|and from the evil of darkness when it settles
113|4|and from the evil of the blowers in knots
113|5|and from the evil of an envier when he envies
114|1|say i seek refuge in the lord of mankind
114|2|the sovereign of mankind
114|3|the god of mankind
114|4|from the evil of the retreating whisperer
114|5|who whispers evil into the breasts of mankind
114|6|from among the jinn and mankind
