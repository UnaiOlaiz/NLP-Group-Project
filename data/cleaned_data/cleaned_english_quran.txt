in the name of allah the entirely merciful the especially merciful
all praise is due to allah lord of the worlds
the entirely merciful the especially merciful
sovereign of the day of recompense
it is you we worship and you we ask for help
guide us to the straight path
the path of those upon whom you have bestowed favor not of those who have evoked your anger or of those who are astray
alif lam meem
this is the book about which there is no doubt a guidance for those conscious of allah
who believe in the unseen establish prayer and spend out of what we have provided for them
and who believe in what has been revealed to you o muhammad and what was revealed before you and of the hereafter they are certain in faith
those are upon right guidance from their lord and it is those who are the successful
indeed those who disbelieve it is all the same for them whether you warn them or do not warn them they will not believe
allah has set a seal upon their hearts and upon their hearing and over their vision is a veil and for them is a great punishment
and of the people are some who say we believe in allah and the last day but they are not believers
they think to deceive allah and those who believe but they deceive not except themselves and perceive it not
in their hearts is disease so allah has increased their disease and for them is a painful punishment because they habitually used to lie
and when it is said to them do not cause corruption on the earth they say we are but reformers
unquestionably it is they who are the corrupters but they perceive it not
and when it is said to them believe as the people have believed they say should we believe as the foolish have believed unquestionably it is they who are the foolish but they know it not
and when they meet those who believe they say we believe but when they are alone with their evil ones they say indeed we are with you we were only mockers
but allah mocks them and prolongs them in their transgression while they wander blindly
those are the ones who have purchased error in exchange for guidance so their transaction has brought no profit nor were they guided
their example is that of one who kindled a fire but when it illuminated what was around him allah took away their light and left them in darkness so they could not see
deaf dumb and blind so they will not return to the right path
or it is like a rainstorm from the sky within which is darkness thunder and lightning they put their fingers in their ears against the thunderclaps in dread of death but allah is encompassing of the disbelievers
the lightning almost snatches away their sight every time it lights the way for them they walk therein but when darkness comes over them they stand still and if allah had willed he could have taken away their hearing and their sight indeed allah is over all things competent
o mankind worship your lord who created you and those before you that you may become righteous
he who made for you the earth a bed spread out and the sky a ceiling and sent down from the sky rain and brought forth thereby fruits as provision for you so do not attribute to allah equals while you know that there is nothing similar to him
and if you are in doubt about what we have sent down upon our servant muhammad then produce a surah the like thereof and call upon your witnesses other than allah if you should be truthful
but if you do not and you will never be able to then fear the fire whose fuel is men and stones prepared for the disbelievers
and give good tidings to those who believe and do righteous deeds that they will have gardens in paradise beneath which rivers flow whenever they are provided with a provision of fruit therefrom they will say this is what we were provided with before and it is given to them in likeness and they will have therein purified spouses and they will abide therein eternally
indeed allah is not timid to present an example that of a mosquito or what is smaller than it and those who have believed know that it is the truth from their lord but as for those who disbelieve they say what did allah intend by this as an example he misleads many thereby and guides many thereby and he misleads not except the defiantly disobedient
who break the covenant of allah after contracting it and sever that which allah has ordered to be joined and cause corruption on earth it is those who are the losers
how can you disbelieve in allah when you were lifeless and he brought you to life then he will cause you to die then he will bring you back to life and then to him you will be returned
it is he who created for you all of that which is on the earth then he directed himself to the heaven his being above all creation and made them seven heavens and he is knowing of all things
and mention o muhammad when your lord said to the angels indeed i will make upon the earth a successive authority they said will you place upon it one who causes corruption therein and sheds blood while we declare your praise and sanctify you allah said indeed i know that which you do not know
and he taught adam the names all of them then he showed them to the angels and said inform me of the names of these if you are truthful
they said exalted are you we have no knowledge except what you have taught us indeed it is you who is the knowing the wise
he said o adam inform them of their names and when he had informed them of their names he said did i not tell you that i know the unseen aspects of the heavens and the earth and i know what you reveal and what you have concealed
and mention when we said to the angels prostrate before adam so they prostrated except for iblees he refused and was arrogant and became of the disbelievers
and we said o adam dwell you and your wife in paradise and eat therefrom in ease and abundance from wherever you will but do not approach this tree lest you be among the wrongdoers
but satan caused them to slip out of it and removed them from that condition in which they had been and we said go down all of you as enemies to one another and you will have upon the earth a place of settlement and provision for a time
then adam received from his lord some words and he accepted his repentance indeed it is he who is the accepting of repentance the merciful
we said go down from it all of you and when guidance comes to you from me whoever follows my guidance there will be no fear concerning them nor will they grieve
and those who disbelieve and deny our signs those will be companions of the fire they will abide therein eternally
o children of israel remember my favor which i have bestowed upon you and fulfill my covenant upon you that i will fulfill your covenant from me and be afraid of only me
and believe in what i have sent down confirming that which is already with you and be not the first to disbelieve in it and do not exchange my signs for a small price and fear only me
and do not mix the truth with falsehood or conceal the truth while you know it
and establish prayer and give zakah and bow with those who bow in worship and obedience
do you order righteousness of the people and forget yourselves while you recite the scripture then will you not reason
and seek help through patience and prayer and indeed it is difficult except for the humbly submissive to allah
who are certain that they will meet their lord and that they will return to him
o children of israel remember my favor that i have bestowed upon you and that i preferred you over the worlds
and fear a day when no soul will suffice for another soul at all nor will intercession be accepted from it nor will compensation be taken from it nor will they be aided
and recall when we saved your forefathers from the people of pharaoh who afflicted you with the worst torment slaughtering your newborn sons and keeping your females alive and in that was a great trial from your lord
and recall when we parted the sea for you and saved you and drowned the people of pharaoh while you were looking on
and recall when we made an appointment with moses for forty nights then you took for worship the calf after him while you were wrongdoers
then we forgave you after that so perhaps you would be grateful
and recall when we gave moses the scripture and criterion that perhaps you would be guided
and recall when moses said to his people o my people indeed you have wronged yourselves by your taking of the calf for worship so repent to your creator and kill yourselves that is best for all of you in the sight of your creator then he accepted your repentance indeed he is the accepting of repentance the merciful
and recall when you said o moses we will never believe you until we see allah outright so the thunderbolt took you while you were looking on
then we revived you after your death that perhaps you would be grateful
and we shaded you with clouds and sent down to you manna and quails saying eat from the good things with which we have provided you and they wronged us not but they were only wronging themselves
and recall when we said enter this city and eat from it wherever you will in ease and abundance and enter the gate bowing humbly and say relieve us of our burdens we will then forgive your sins for you and we will increase the doers of good in goodness and reward
but those who wronged changed those words to a statement other than that which had been said to them so we sent down upon those who wronged a punishment from the sky because they were defiantly disobeying
and recall when moses prayed for water for his people so we said strike with your staff the stone and there gushed forth from it twelve springs and every people knew its watering place eat and drink from the provision of allah and do not commit abuse on the earth spreading corruption
and recall when you said o moses we can never endure one kind of food so call upon your lord to bring forth for us from the earth its green herbs and its cucumbers and its garlic and its lentils and its onions moses said would you exchange what is better for what is less go into any settlement and indeed you will have what you have asked and they were covered with humiliation and poverty and returned with anger from allah upon them that was because they repeatedly disbelieved in the signs of allah and killed the prophets without right that was because they disobeyed and were habitually transgressing
indeed those who believed and those who were jews or christians or sabeans before prophet muhammad those among them who believed in allah and the last day and did righteousness will have their reward with their lord and no fear will there be concerning them nor will they grieve
and recall when we took your covenant o children of israel to abide by the torah and we raised over you the mount saying take what we have given you with determination and remember what is in it that perhaps you may become righteous
then you turned away after that and if not for the favor of allah upon you and his mercy you would have been among the losers
and you had already known about those who transgressed among you concerning the sabbath and we said to them be apes despised
and we made it a deterrent punishment for those who were present and those who succeeded them and a lesson for those who fear allah
and recall when moses said to his people indeed allah commands you to slaughter a cow they said do you take us in ridicule he said i seek refuge in allah from being among the ignorant
they said call upon your lord to make clear to us what it is moses said allah says it is a cow which is neither old nor virgin but median between that so do what you are commanded
they said call upon your lord to show us what is her color he said he says it is a yellow cow bright in color pleasing to the observers
they said call upon your lord to make clear to us what it is indeed all cows look alike to us and indeed we if allah wills will be guided
he said he says it is a cow neither trained to plow the earth nor to irrigate the field one free from fault with no spot upon her they said now you have come with the truth so they slaughtered her but they could hardly do it
and recall when you slew a man and disputed over it but allah was to bring out that which you were concealing
so we said strike the slain man with part of it thus does allah bring the dead to life and he shows you his signs that you might reason
then your hearts became hardened after that being like stones or even harder for indeed there are stones from which rivers burst forth and there are some of them that split open and water comes out and there are some of them that fall down for fear of allah and allah is not unaware of what you do
do you covet the hope o believers that they would believe for you while a party of them used to hear the words of allah and then distort the torah after they had understood it while they were knowing
and when they meet those who believe they say we have believed but when they are alone with one another they say do you talk to them about what allah has revealed to you so they can argue with you about it before your lord then will you not reason
but do they not know that allah knows what they conceal and what they declare
and among them are unlettered ones who do not know the scripture except in wishful thinking but they are only assuming
so woe to those who write the scripture with their own hands then say this is from allah in order to exchange it for a small price woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for what they earn
and they say never will the fire touch us except for a few days say have you taken a covenant with allah for allah will never break his covenant or do you say about allah that which you do not know
yes whoever earns evil and his sin has encompassed him those are the companions of the fire they will abide therein eternally
but they who believe and do righteous deeds those are the companions of paradise they will abide therein eternally
and recall when we took the covenant from the children of israel enjoining upon them do not worship except allah and to parents do good and to relatives orphans and the needy and speak to people good words and establish prayer and give zakah then you turned away except a few of you and you were refusing
and recall when we took your covenant saying do not shed each other s blood or evict one another from your homes then you acknowledged this while you were witnessing
then you are those same ones who are killing one another and evicting a party of your people from their homes cooperating against them in sin and aggression and if they come to you as captives you ransom them although their eviction was forbidden to you so do you believe in part of the scripture and disbelieve in part then what is the recompense for those who do that among you except disgrace in worldly life and on the day of resurrection they will be sent back to the severest of punishment and allah is not unaware of what you do
those are the ones who have bought the life of this world in exchange for the hereafter so the punishment will not be lightened for them nor will they be aided
and we did certainly give moses the torah and followed up after him with messengers and we gave jesus the son of mary clear proofs and supported him with the pure spirit but is it not that every time a messenger came to you o children of israel with what your souls did not desire you were arrogant and a party of messengers you denied and another party you killed
and they said our hearts are wrapped but in fact allah has cursed them for their disbelief so little is it that they believe
and when there came to them a book from allah confirming that which was with them although before they used to pray for victory against those who disbelieved but then when there came to them that which they recognized they disbelieved in it so the curse of allah will be upon the disbelievers
how wretched is that for which they sold themselves that they would disbelieve in what allah has revealed through their outrage that allah would send down his favor upon whom he wills from among his servants so they returned having earned wrath upon wrath and for the disbelievers is a humiliating punishment
and when it is said to them believe in what allah has revealed they say we believe only in what was revealed to us and they disbelieve in what came after it while it is the truth confirming that which is with them say then why did you kill the prophets of allah before if you are indeed believers
and moses had certainly brought you clear proofs then you took the calf in worship after that while you were wrongdoers
and recall when we took your covenant and raised over you the mount saying take what we have given you with determination and listen they said instead we hear and disobey and their hearts absorbed the worship of the calf because of their disbelief say how wretched is that which your faith enjoins upon you if you should be believers
say o muhammad if the home of the hereafter with allah is for you alone and not the other people then wish for death if you should be truthful
but they will never wish for it ever because of what their hands have put forth and allah is knowing of the wrongdoers
and you will surely find them the most greedy of people for life even more than those who associate others with allah one of them wishes that he could be granted life a thousand years but it would not remove him in the least from the coming punishment that he should be granted life and allah is seeing of what they do
say whoever is an enemy to gabriel it is none but he who has brought the qur an down upon your heart o muhammad by permission of allah confirming that which was before it and as guidance and good tidings for the believers
whoever is an enemy to allah and his angels and his messengers and gabriel and michael then indeed allah is an enemy to the disbelievers
and we have certainly revealed to you verses which are clear proofs and no one would deny them except the defiantly disobedient
is it not true that every time they took a covenant a party of them threw it away but in fact most of them do not believe
and when a messenger from allah came to them confirming that which was with them a party of those who had been given the scripture threw the scripture of allah behind their backs as if they did not know what it contained
and they followed instead what the devils had recited during the reign of solomon it was not solomon who disbelieved but the devils disbelieved teaching people magic and that which was revealed to the two angels at babylon harut and marut but the two angels do not teach anyone unless they say we are a trial so do not disbelieve by practicing magic and yet they learn from them that by which they cause separation between a man and his wife but they do not harm anyone through it except by permission of allah and the people learn what harms them and does not benefit them but the children of israel certainly knew that whoever purchased the magic would not have in the hereafter any share and wretched is that for which they sold themselves if they only knew
and if they had believed and feared allah then the reward from allah would have been far better if they only knew
o you who have believed say not to allah s messenger ra ina but say unthurna and listen and for the disbelievers is a painful punishment
neither those who disbelieve from the people of the scripture nor the polytheists wish that any good should be sent down to you from your lord but allah selects for his mercy whom he wills and allah is the possessor of great bounty
we do not abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten except that we bring forth one better than it or similar to it do you not know that allah is over all things competent
do you not know that to allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and that you have not besides allah any protector or any helper
or do you intend to ask your messenger as moses was asked before and whoever exchanges faith for disbelief has certainly strayed from the soundness of the way
many of the people of the scripture wish they could turn you back to disbelief after you have believed out of envy from themselves even after the truth has become clear to them so pardon and overlook until allah delivers his command indeed allah is over all things competent
and establish prayer and give zakah and whatever good you put forward for yourselves you will find it with allah indeed allah of what you do is seeing
and they say none will enter paradise except one who is a jew or a christian that is merely their wishful thinking say produce your proof if you should be truthful
yes on the contrary whoever submits his face in islam to allah while being a doer of good will have his reward with his lord and no fear will there be concerning them nor will they grieve
the jews say the christians have nothing true to stand on and the christians say the jews have nothing to stand on although they both recite the scripture thus the polytheists speak the same as their words but allah will judge between them on the day of resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ
and who are more unjust than those who prevent the name of allah from being mentioned in his mosques and strive toward their destruction it is not for them to enter them except in fear for them in this world is disgrace and they will have in the hereafter a great punishment
and to allah belongs the east and the west so wherever you might turn there is the face of allah indeed allah is all encompassing and knowing
they say allah has taken a son exalted is he rather to him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth all are devoutly obedient to him
originator of the heavens and the earth when he decrees a matter he only says to it be and it is
those who do not know say why does allah not speak to us or there come to us a sign thus spoke those before them like their words their hearts resemble each other we have shown clearly the signs to a people who are certain in faith
indeed we have sent you o muhammad with the truth as a bringer of good tidings and a warner and you will not be asked about the companions of hellfire
and never will the jews or the christians approve of you until you follow their religion say indeed the guidance of allah is the only guidance if you were to follow their desires after what has come to you of knowledge you would have against allah no protector or helper
those to whom we have given the book recite it with its true recital they are the ones who believe in it and whoever disbelieves in it it is they who are the losers
o children of israel remember my favor which i have bestowed upon you and that i preferred you over the worlds
and fear a day when no soul will suffice for another soul at all and no compensation will be accepted from it nor will any intercession benefit it nor will they be aided
and mention o muhammad when abraham was tried by his lord with commands and he fulfilled them allah said indeed i will make you a leader for the people abraham said and of my descendants allah said my covenant does not include the wrongdoers
and mention when we made the house a place of return for the people and a place of security and take o believers from the standing place of abraham a place of prayer and we charged abraham and ishmael saying purify my house for those who perform tawaf and those who are staying there for worship and those who bow and prostrate in prayer
and mention when abraham said my lord make this a secure city and provide its people with fruits whoever of them believes in allah and the last day allah said and whoever disbelieves i will grant him enjoyment for a little then i will force him to the punishment of the fire and wretched is the destination
and mention when abraham was raising the foundations of the house and with him ishmael saying our lord accept this from us indeed you are the hearing the knowing
our lord and make us muslims in submission to you and from our descendants a muslim nation in submission to you and show us our rites and accept our repentance indeed you are the accepting of repentance the merciful
our lord and send among them a messenger from themselves who will recite to them your verses and teach them the book and wisdom and purify them indeed you are the exalted in might the wise
and who would be averse to the religion of abraham except one who makes a fool of himself and we had chosen him in this world and indeed he in the hereafter will be among the righteous
when his lord said to him submit he said i have submitted in islam to the lord of the worlds
and abraham instructed his sons to do the same and so did jacob saying o my sons indeed allah has chosen for you this religion so do not die except while you are muslims
or were you witnesses when death approached jacob when he said to his sons what will you worship after me they said we will worship your god and the god of your fathers abraham and ishmael and isaac one god and we are muslims in submission to him
that was a nation which has passed on it will have the consequence of what it earned and you will have what you have earned and you will not be asked about what they used to do
they say be jews or christians so you will be guided say rather we follow the religion of abraham inclining toward truth and he was not of the polytheists
say o believers we have believed in allah and what has been revealed to us and what has been revealed to abraham and ishmael and isaac and jacob and the descendants and what was given to moses and jesus and what was given to the prophets from their lord we make no distinction between any of them and we are muslims in submission to him
so if they believe in the same as you believe in then they have been rightly guided but if they turn away they are only in dissension and allah will be sufficient for you against them and he is the hearing the knowing
and say ours is the religion of allah and who is better than allah in ordaining religion and we are worshippers of him
say o muhammad do you argue with us about allah while he is our lord and your lord for us are our deeds and for you are your deeds and we are sincere in deed and intention to him
or do you say that abraham and ishmael and isaac and jacob and the descendants were jews or christians say are you more knowing or is allah and who is more unjust than one who conceals a testimony he has from allah and allah is not unaware of what you do
that is a nation which has passed on it will have the consequence of what it earned and you will have what you have earned and you will not be asked about what they used to do
the foolish among the people will say what has turned them away from their qiblah which they used to face say to allah belongs the east and the west he guides whom he wills to a straight path
and thus we have made you a just community that you will be witnesses over the people and the messenger will be a witness over you and we did not make the qiblah which you used to face except that we might make evident who would follow the messenger from who would turn back on his heels and indeed it is difficult except for those whom allah has guided and never would allah have caused you to lose your faith indeed allah is to the people kind and merciful
we have certainly seen the turning of your face o muhammad toward the heaven and we will surely turn you to a qiblah with which you will be pleased so turn your face toward al masjid al haram and wherever you believers are turn your faces toward it in prayer indeed those who have been given the scripture well know that it is the truth from their lord and allah is not unaware of what they do
and if you brought to those who were given the scripture every sign they would not follow your qiblah nor will you be a follower of their qiblah nor would they be followers of one another s qiblah so if you were to follow their desires after what has come to you of knowledge indeed you would then be among the wrongdoers
those to whom we gave the scripture know him as they know their own sons but indeed a party of them conceal the truth while they know it
the truth is from your lord so never be among the doubters
for each religious following is a direction toward which it faces so race to all that is good wherever you may be allah will bring you forth for judgement all together indeed allah is over all things competent
so from wherever you go out for prayer o muhammad turn your face toward al masjid al haram and indeed it is the truth from your lord and allah is not unaware of what you do
and from wherever you go out for prayer turn your face toward al masjid al haram and wherever you believers may be turn your faces toward it in order that the people will not have any argument against you except for those of them who commit wrong so fear them not but fear me and it is so i may complete my favor upon you and that you may be guided
just as we have sent among you a messenger from yourselves reciting to you our verses and purifying you and teaching you the book and wisdom and teaching you that which you did not know
so remember me i will remember you and be grateful to me and do not deny me
o you who have believed seek help through patience and prayer indeed allah is with the patient
and do not say about those who are killed in the way of allah they are dead rather they are alive but you perceive it not
and we will surely test you with something of fear and hunger and a loss of wealth and lives and fruits but give good tidings to the patient
who when disaster strikes them say indeed we belong to allah and indeed to him we will return
those are the ones upon whom are blessings from their lord and mercy and it is those who are the rightly guided
indeed as safa and al marwah are among the symbols of allah so whoever makes hajj to the house or performs umrah there is no blame upon him for walking between them and whoever volunteers good then indeed allah is appreciative and knowing
indeed those who conceal what we sent down of clear proofs and guidance after we made it clear for the people in the scripture those are cursed by allah and cursed by those who curse
except for those who repent and correct themselves and make evident what they concealed those i will accept their repentance and i am the accepting of repentance the merciful
indeed those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers upon them will be the curse of allah and of the angels and the people all together
abiding eternally therein the punishment will not be lightened for them nor will they be reprieved
and your god is one god there is no deity worthy of worship except him the entirely merciful the especially merciful
indeed in the creation of the heavens and earth and the alternation of the night and the day and the great ships which sail through the sea with that which benefits people and what allah has sent down from the heavens of rain giving life thereby to the earth after its lifelessness and dispersing therein every kind of moving creature and his directing of the winds and the clouds controlled between the heaven and the earth are signs for a people who use reason
and yet among the people are those who take other than allah as equals to him they love them as they should love allah but those who believe are stronger in love for allah and if only they who have wronged would consider that when they see the punishment they will be certain that all power belongs to allah and that allah is severe in punishment
and they should consider that when those who have been followed disassociate themselves from those who followed them and they all see the punishment and cut off from them are the ties of relationship
those who followed will say if only we had another turn at worldly life so we could disassociate ourselves from them as they have disassociated themselves from us thus will allah show them their deeds as regrets upon them and they are never to emerge from the fire
o mankind eat from whatever is on earth that is lawful and good and do not follow the footsteps of satan indeed he is to you a clear enemy
he only orders you to evil and immorality and to say about allah what you do not know
and when it is said to them follow what allah has revealed they say rather we will follow that which we found our fathers doing even though their fathers understood nothing nor were they guided
the example of those who disbelieve is like that of one who shouts at what hears nothing but calls and cries cattle or sheep deaf dumb and blind so they do not understand
o you who have believed eat from the good things which we have provided for you and be grateful to allah if it is indeed him that you worship
he has only forbidden to you dead animals blood the flesh of swine and that which has been dedicated to other than allah but whoever is forced by necessity neither desiring it nor transgressing its limit there is no sin upon him indeed allah is forgiving and merciful
indeed they who conceal what allah has sent down of the book and exchange it for a small price those consume not into their bellies except the fire and allah will not speak to them on the day of resurrection nor will he purify them and they will have a painful punishment
those are the ones who have exchanged guidance for error and forgiveness for punishment how patient they are in pursuit of the fire
that is deserved by them because allah has sent down the book in truth and indeed those who differ over the book are in extreme dissension
righteousness is not that you turn your faces toward the east or the west but true righteousness is in one who believes in allah the last day the angels the book and the prophets and gives wealth in spite of love for it to relatives orphans the needy the traveler those who ask for help and for freeing slaves and who establishes prayer and gives zakah those who fulfill their promise when they promise and those who are patient in poverty and hardship and during battle those are the ones who have been true and it is those who are the righteous
o you who have believed prescribed for you is legal retribution for those murdered the free for the free the slave for the slave and the female for the female but whoever overlooks from his brother anything then there should be a suitable follow up and payment to him with good conduct this is an alleviation from your lord and a mercy but whoever transgresses after that will have a painful punishment
and there is for you in legal retribution saving of life o you people of understanding that you may become righteous
prescribed for you when death approaches any one of you if he leaves wealth is that he should make a bequest for the parents and near relatives according to what is acceptable a duty upon the righteous
then whoever alters the bequest after he has heard it the sin is only upon those who have altered it indeed allah is hearing and knowing
but if one fears from the bequeather some error or sin and corrects that which is between them there is no sin upon him indeed allah is forgiving and merciful
o you who have believed decreed upon you is fasting as it was decreed upon those before you that you may become righteous
fasting for a limited number of days so whoever among you is ill or on a journey during them then an equal number of days are to be made up and upon those who are able to fast but with hardship a ransom as substitute of feeding a poor person each day and whoever volunteers excess it is better for him but to fast is best for you if you only knew
the month of ramadhan is that in which was revealed the qur an a guidance for the people and clear proofs of guidance and criterion so whoever sights the new moon of the month let him fast it and whoever is ill or on a journey then an equal number of other days allah intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship and wants for you to complete the period and to glorify allah for that to which he has guided you and perhaps you will be grateful
and when my servants ask you o muhammad concerning me indeed i am near i respond to the invocation of the supplicant when he calls upon me so let them respond to me by obedience and believe in me that they may be rightly guided
it has been made permissible for you the night preceding fasting to go to your wives for sexual relations they are clothing for you and you are clothing for them allah knows that you used to deceive yourselves so he accepted your repentance and forgave you so now have relations with them and seek that which allah has decreed for you and eat and drink until the white thread of dawn becomes distinct to you from the black thread of night then complete the fast until the sunset and do not have relations with them as long as you are staying for worship in the mosques these are the limits set by allah so do not approach them thus does allah make clear his ordinances to the people that they may become righteous
and do not consume one another s wealth unjustly or send it in bribery to the rulers in order that they might aid you to consume a portion of the wealth of the people in sin while you know it is unlawful
they ask you o muhammad about the new moons say they are measurements of time for the people and for hajj and it is not righteousness to enter houses from the back but righteousness is in one who fears allah and enter houses from their doors and fear allah that you may succeed
fight in the way of allah those who fight you but do not transgress indeed allah does not like transgressors
and kill them wherever you overtake them and expel them from wherever they have expelled you and fitnah is worse than killing and do not fight them at al masjid al haram until they fight you there but if they fight you then kill them such is the recompense of the disbelievers
and if they cease then indeed allah is forgiving and merciful
fight them until there is no more fitnah and until worship is acknowledged to be for allah but if they cease then there is to be no aggression except against the oppressors
fighting in the sacred month is for aggression committed in the sacred month and for all violations is legal retribution so whoever has assaulted you then assault him in the same way that he has assaulted you and fear allah and know that allah is with those who fear him
and spend in the way of allah and do not throw yourselves with your own hands into destruction by refraining and do good indeed allah loves the doers of good
and complete the hajj and umrah for allah but if you are prevented then offer what can be obtained with ease of sacrificial animals and do not shave your heads until the sacrificial animal has reached its place of slaughter and whoever among you is ill or has an ailment of the head making shaving necessary must offer a ransom of fasting three days or charity or sacrifice and when you are secure then whoever performs umrah during the hajj months followed by hajj offers what can be obtained with ease of sacrificial animals and whoever cannot find or afford such an animal then a fast of three days during hajj and of seven when you have returned home those are ten complete days this is for those whose family is not in the area of al masjid al haram and fear allah and know that allah is severe in penalty
hajj is during well known months so whoever has made hajj obligatory upon himself therein by entering the state of ihram there is to be for him no sexual relations and no disobedience and no disputing during hajj and whatever good you do allah knows it and take provisions but indeed the best provision is fear of allah and fear me o you of understanding
there is no blame upon you for seeking bounty from your lord during hajj but when you depart from arafat remember allah at al mash ar al haram and remember him as he has guided you for indeed you were before that among those astray
then depart from the place from where all the people depart and ask forgiveness of allah indeed allah is forgiving and merciful
and when you have completed your rites remember allah like your previous remembrance of your fathers or with much greater remembrance and among the people is he who says our lord give us in this world and he will have in the hereafter no share
but among them is he who says our lord give us in this world that which is good and in the hereafter that which is good and protect us from the punishment of the fire
those will have a share of what they have earned and allah is swift in account
and remember allah during specific numbered days then whoever hastens his departure in two days there is no sin upon him and whoever delays until the third there is no sin upon him for him who fears allah and fear allah and know that unto him you will be gathered
and of the people is he whose speech pleases you in worldly life and he calls allah to witness as to what is in his heart yet he is the fiercest of opponents
and when he goes away he strives throughout the land to cause corruption therein and destroy crops and animals and allah does not like corruption
and when it is said to him fear allah pride in the sin takes hold of him sufficient for him is hellfire and how wretched is the resting place
and of the people is he who sells himself seeking means to the approval of allah and allah is kind to his servants
o you who have believed enter into islam completely and perfectly and do not follow the footsteps of satan indeed he is to you a clear enemy
but if you deviate after clear proofs have come to you then know that allah is exalted in might and wise
do they await but that allah should come to them in covers of clouds and the angels as well and the matter is then decided and to allah all matters are returned
ask the children of israel how many a sign of evidence we have given them and whoever exchanges the favor of allah for disbelief after it has come to him then indeed allah is severe in penalty
beautified for those who disbelieve is the life of this world and they ridicule those who believe but those who fear allah are above them on the day of resurrection and allah gives provision to whom he wills without account
mankind was of one religion before their deviation then allah sent the prophets as bringers of good tidings and warners and sent down with them the scripture in truth to judge between the people concerning that in which they differed and none differed over the scripture except those who were given it after the clear proofs came to them out of jealous animosity among themselves and allah guided those who believed to the truth concerning that over which they had differed by his permission and allah guides whom he wills to a straight path
or do you think that you will enter paradise while such trial has not yet come to you as came to those who passed on before you they were touched by poverty and hardship and were shaken until even their messenger and those who believed with him said when is the help of allah unquestionably the help of allah is near
they ask you o muhammad what they should spend say whatever you spend of good is to be for parents and relatives and orphans and the needy and the traveler and whatever you do of good indeed allah is knowing of it
fighting has been enjoined upon you while it is hateful to you but perhaps you hate a thing and it is good for you and perhaps you love a thing and it is bad for you and allah knows while you know not
they ask you about the sacred month about fighting therein say fighting therein is great sin but averting people from the way of allah and disbelief in him and preventing access to al masjid al haram and the expulsion of its people therefrom are greater evil in the sight of allah and fitnah is greater than killing and they will continue to fight you until they turn you back from your religion if they are able and whoever of you reverts from his religion to disbelief and dies while he is a disbeliever for those their deeds have become worthless in this world and the hereafter and those are the companions of the fire they will abide therein eternally
indeed those who have believed and those who have emigrated and fought in the cause of allah those expect the mercy of allah and allah is forgiving and merciful
they ask you about wine and gambling say in them is great sin and yet some benefit for people but their sin is greater than their benefit and they ask you what they should spend say the excess beyond needs thus allah makes clear to you the verses of revelation that you might give thought
to this world and the hereafter and they ask you about orphans say improvement for them is best and if you mix your affairs with theirs they are your brothers and allah knows the corrupter from the amender and if allah had willed he could have put you in difficulty indeed allah is exalted in might and wise
and do not marry polytheistic women until they believe and a believing slave woman is better than a polytheist even though she might please you and do not marry polytheistic men to your women until they believe and a believing slave is better than a polytheist even though he might please you those invite you to the fire but allah invites to paradise and to forgiveness by his permission and he makes clear his verses to the people that perhaps they may remember
and they ask you about menstruation say it is harm so keep away from wives during menstruation and do not approach them until they are pure and when they have purified themselves then come to them from where allah has ordained for you indeed allah loves those who are constantly repentant and loves those who purify themselves
your wives are a place of sowing of seed for you so come to your place of cultivation however you wish and put forth righteousness for yourselves and fear allah and know that you will meet him and give good tidings to the believers
and do not make your oath by allah an excuse against being righteous and fearing allah and making peace among people and allah is hearing and knowing
allah does not impose blame upon you for what is unintentional in your oaths but he imposes blame upon you for what your hearts have earned and allah is forgiving and forbearing
for those who swear not to have sexual relations with their wives is a waiting time of four months but if they return to normal relations then indeed allah is forgiving and merciful
and if they decide on divorce then indeed allah is hearing and knowing
divorced women remain in waiting for three periods and it is not lawful for them to conceal what allah has created in their wombs if they believe in allah and the last day and their husbands have more right to take them back in this period if they want reconciliation and due to the wives is similar to what is expected of them according to what is reasonable but the men have a degree over them in responsibility and authority and allah is exalted in might and wise
divorce is twice then either keep her in an acceptable manner or release her with good treatment and it is not lawful for you to take anything of what you have given them unless both fear that they will not be able to keep within the limits of allah but if you fear that they will not keep within the limits of allah then there is no blame upon either of them concerning that by which she ransoms herself these are the limits of allah so do not transgress them and whoever transgresses the limits of allah it is those who are the wrongdoers
and if he has divorced her for the third time then she is not lawful to him afterward until after she marries a husband other than him and if the latter husband divorces her or dies there is no blame upon the woman and her former husband for returning to each other if they think that they can keep within the limits of allah these are the limits of allah which he makes clear to a people who know
and when you divorce women and they have nearly fulfilled their term either retain them according to acceptable terms or release them according to acceptable terms and do not keep them intending harm to transgress against them and whoever does that has certainly wronged himself and do not take the verses of allah in jest and remember the favor of allah upon you and what has been revealed to you of the book and wisdom by which he instructs you and fear allah and know that allah is knowing of all things
and when you divorce women and they have fulfilled their term do not prevent them from remarrying their former husbands if they agree among themselves on an acceptable basis that is instructed to whoever of you believes in allah and the last day that is better for you and purer and allah knows and you know not
mothers may breastfeed their children two complete years for whoever wishes to complete the nursing period upon the father is the mothers provision and their clothing according to what is acceptable no person is charged with more than his capacity no mother should be harmed through her child and no father through his child and upon the father s heir is a duty like that of the father and if they both desire weaning through mutual consent from both of them and consultation there is no blame upon either of them and if you wish to have your children nursed by a substitute there is no blame upon you as long as you give payment according to what is acceptable and fear allah and know that allah is seeing of what you do
and those who are taken in death among you and leave wives behind they the wives shall wait four months and ten days and when they have fulfilled their term then there is no blame upon you for what they do with themselves in an acceptable manner and allah is fully acquainted with what you do
there is no blame upon you for that to which you indirectly allude concerning a proposal to women or for what you conceal within yourselves allah knows that you will have them in mind but do not promise them secretly except for saying a proper saying and do not determine to undertake a marriage contract until the decreed period reaches its end and know that allah knows what is within yourselves so beware of him and know that allah is forgiving and forbearing
there is no blame upon you if you divorce women you have not touched nor specified for them an obligation but give them a gift of compensation the wealthy according to his capability and the poor according to his capability a provision according to what is acceptable a duty upon the doers of good
and if you divorce them before you have touched them and you have already specified for them an obligation then give half of what you specified unless they forego the right or the one in whose hand is the marriage contract foregoes it and to forego it is nearer to righteousness and do not forget graciousness between you indeed allah of whatever you do is seeing
maintain with care the obligatory prayers and in particular the middle prayer and stand before allah devoutly obedient
and if you fear an enemy then pray on foot or riding but when you are secure then remember allah in prayer as he has taught you that which you did not previously know
and those who are taken in death among you and leave wives behind for their wives is a bequest maintenance for one year without turning them out but if they leave of their own accord then there is no blame upon you for what they do with themselves in an acceptable way and allah is exalted in might and wise
and for divorced women is a provision according to what is acceptable a duty upon the righteous
thus does allah make clear to you his verses that you might use reason
have you not considered those who left their homes in many thousands fearing death allah said to them die then he restored them to life and allah is full of bounty to the people but most of the people do not show gratitude
and fight in the cause of allah and know that allah is hearing and knowing
who is it that would loan allah a goodly loan so he may multiply it for him many times over and it is allah who withholds and grants abundance and to him you will be returned
have you not considered the assembly of the children of israel after the time of moses when they said to a prophet of theirs send to us a king and we will fight in the way of allah he said would you perhaps refrain from fighting if fighting was prescribed for you they said and why should we not fight in the cause of allah when we have been driven out from our homes and from our children but when fighting was prescribed for them they turned away except for a few of them and allah is knowing of the wrongdoers
and their prophet said to them indeed allah has sent to you saul as a king they said how can he have kingship over us while we are more worthy of kingship than him and he has not been given any measure of wealth he said indeed allah has chosen him over you and has increased him abundantly in knowledge and stature and allah gives his sovereignty to whom he wills and allah is all encompassing in favor and knowing
and their prophet said to them indeed a sign of his kingship is that the chest will come to you in which is assurance from your lord and a remnant of what the family of moses and the family of aaron had left carried by the angels indeed in that is a sign for you if you are believers
and when saul went forth with the soldiers he said indeed allah will be testing you with a river so whoever drinks from it is not of me and whoever does not taste it is indeed of me excepting one who takes from it in the hollow of his hand but they drank from it except a very few of them then when he had crossed it along with those who believed with him they said there is no power for us today against goliath and his soldiers but those who were certain that they would meet allah said how many a small company has overcome a large company by permission of allah and allah is with the patient
and when they went forth to face goliath and his soldiers they said our lord pour upon us patience and plant firmly our feet and give us victory over the disbelieving people
so they defeated them by permission of allah and david killed goliath and allah gave him the kingship and prophethood and taught him from that which he willed and if it were not for allah checking some people by means of others the earth would have been corrupted but allah is full of bounty to the worlds
these are the verses of allah which we recite to you o muhammad in truth and indeed you are from among the messengers
those messengers some of them we caused to exceed others among them were those to whom allah spoke and he raised some of them in degree and we gave jesus the son of mary clear proofs and we supported him with the pure spirit if allah had willed those generations succeeding them would not have fought each other after the clear proofs had come to them but they differed and some of them believed and some of them disbelieved and if allah had willed they would not have fought each other but allah does what he intends
o you who have believed spend from that which we have provided for you before there comes a day in which there is no exchange and no friendship and no intercession and the disbelievers they are the wrongdoers
allah there is no deity except him the ever living the sustainer of all existence neither drowsiness overtakes him nor sleep to him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth who is it that can intercede with him except by his permission he knows what is presently before them and what will be after them and they encompass not a thing of his knowledge except for what he wills his kursi extends over the heavens and the earth and their preservation tires him not and he is the most high the most great
there shall be no compulsion in acceptance of the religion the right course has become clear from the wrong so whoever disbelieves in taghut and believes in allah has grasped the most trustworthy handhold with no break in it and allah is hearing and knowing
allah is the ally of those who believe he brings them out from darknesses into the light and those who disbelieve their allies are taghut they take them out of the light into darknesses those are the companions of the fire they will abide eternally therein
have you not considered the one who argued with abraham about his lord merely because allah had given him kingship when abraham said my lord is the one who gives life and causes death he said i give life and cause death abraham said indeed allah brings up the sun from the east so bring it up from the west so the disbeliever was overwhelmed by astonishment and allah does not guide the wrongdoing people
or consider such an example as the one who passed by a township which had fallen into ruin he said how will allah bring this to life after its death so allah caused him to die for a hundred years then he revived him he said how long have you remained the man said i have remained a day or part of a day he said rather you have remained one hundred years look at your food and your drink it has not changed with time and look at your donkey and we will make you a sign for the people and look at the bones of this donkey how we raise them and then we cover them with flesh and when it became clear to him he said i know that allah is over all things competent
and mention when abraham said my lord show me how you give life to the dead allah said have you not believed he said yes but i ask only that my heart may be satisfied allah said take four birds and commit them to yourself then after slaughtering them put on each hill a portion of them then call them they will come flying to you in haste and know that allah is exalted in might and wise
the example of those who spend their wealth in the way of allah is like a seed of grain which grows seven spikes in each spike is a hundred grains and allah multiplies his reward for whom he wills and allah is all encompassing and knowing
those who spend their wealth in the way of allah and then do not follow up what they have spent with reminders of it or other injury will have their reward with their lord and there will be no fear concerning them nor will they grieve
kind speech and forgiveness are better than charity followed by injury and allah is free of need and forbearing
o you who have believed do not invalidate your charities with reminders or injury as does one who spends his wealth only to be seen by the people and does not believe in allah and the last day his example is like that of a large smooth stone upon which is dust and is hit by a downpour that leaves it bare they are unable to keep anything of what they have earned and allah does not guide the disbelieving people
and the example of those who spend their wealth seeking means to the approval of allah and assuring reward for themselves is like a garden on high ground which is hit by a downpour so it yields its fruits in double and even if it is not hit by a downpour then a drizzle is sufficient and allah of what you do is seeing
would one of you like to have a garden of palm trees and grapevines underneath which rivers flow in which he has from every fruit but he is afflicted with old age and has weak offspring and it is hit by a whirlwind containing fire and is burned thus does allah make clear to you his verses that you might give thought
o you who have believed spend from the good things which you have earned and from that which we have produced for you from the earth and do not aim toward the defective therefrom spending from that while you would not take it yourself except with closed eyes and know that allah is free of need and praiseworthy
satan threatens you with poverty and orders you to immorality while allah promises you forgiveness from him and bounty and allah is all encompassing and knowing
he gives wisdom to whom he wills and whoever has been given wisdom has certainly been given much good and none will remember except those of understanding
and whatever you spend of expenditures or make of vows indeed allah knows of it and for the wrongdoers there are no helpers
if you disclose your charitable expenditures they are good but if you conceal them and give them to the poor it is better for you and he will remove from you some of your misdeeds thereby and allah with what you do is fully acquainted
not upon you o muhammad is responsibility for their guidance but allah guides whom he wills and whatever good you believers spend is for yourselves and you do not spend except seeking the countenance of allah and whatever you spend of good it will be fully repaid to you and you will not be wronged
charity is for the poor who have been restricted for the cause of allah unable to move about in the land an ignorant person would think them self sufficient because of their restraint but you will know them by their characteristic sign they do not ask people persistently or at all and whatever you spend of good indeed allah is knowing of it
those who spend their wealth in allah s way by night and by day secretly and publicly they will have their reward with their lord and no fear will there be concerning them nor will they grieve
those who consume interest cannot stand on the day of resurrection except as one stands who is being beaten by satan into insanity that is because they say trade is just like interest but allah has permitted trade and has forbidden interest so whoever has received an admonition from his lord and desists may have what is past and his affair rests with allah but whoever returns to dealing in interest or usury those are the companions of the fire they will abide eternally therein
allah destroys interest and gives increase for charities and allah does not like every sinning disbeliever
indeed those who believe and do righteous deeds and establish prayer and give zakah will have their reward with their lord and there will be no fear concerning them nor will they grieve
o you who have believed fear allah and give up what remains due to you of interest if you should be believers
and if you do not then be informed of a war against you from allah and his messenger but if you repent you may have your principal thus you do no wrong nor are you wronged
and if someone is in hardship then let there be postponement until a time of ease but if you give from your right as charity then it is better for you if you only knew
and fear a day when you will be returned to allah then every soul will be compensated for what it earned and they will not be treated unjustly
o you who have believed when you contract a debt for a specified term write it down and let a scribe write it between you in justice let no scribe refuse to write as allah has taught him so let him write and let the one who has the obligation dictate and let him fear allah his lord and not leave anything out of it but if the one who has the obligation is of limited understanding or weak or unable to dictate himself then let his guardian dictate in justice and bring to witness two witnesses from among your men and if there are not two men available then a man and two women from those whom you accept as witnesses so that if one of the women errs then the other can remind her and let not the witnesses refuse when they are called upon and do not be too weary to write it whether it is small or large for its specified term that is more just in the sight of allah and stronger as evidence and more likely to prevent doubt between you except when it is an immediate transaction which you conduct among yourselves for then there is no blame upon you if you do not write it and take witnesses when you conclude a contract let no scribe be harmed or any witness for if you do so indeed it is grave disobedience in you and fear allah and allah teaches you and allah is knowing of all things
and if you are on a journey and cannot find a scribe then a security deposit should be taken and if one of you entrusts another then let him who is entrusted discharge his trust faithfully and let him fear allah his lord and do not conceal testimony for whoever conceals it his heart is indeed sinful and allah is knowing of what you do
to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth whether you show what is within yourselves or conceal it allah will bring you to account for it then he will forgive whom he wills and punish whom he wills and allah is over all things competent
the messenger has believed in what was revealed to him from his lord and so have the believers all of them have believed in allah and his angels and his books and his messengers saying we make no distinction between any of his messengers and they say we hear and we obey we seek your forgiveness our lord and to you is the final destination
allah does not charge a soul except with that within its capacity it will have the consequence of what good it has gained and it will bear the consequence of what evil it has earned our lord do not impose blame upon us if we have forgotten or erred our lord and lay not upon us a burden like that which you laid upon those before us our lord and burden us not with that which we have no ability to bear and pardon us and forgive us and have mercy upon us you are our protector so give us victory over the disbelieving people
alif lam meem
allah there is no deity except him the ever living the sustainer of existence
he has sent down upon you o muhammad the book in truth confirming what was before it and he revealed the torah and the gospel
before as guidance for the people and he revealed the qur an indeed those who disbelieve in the verses of allah will have a severe punishment and allah is exalted in might the owner of retribution
indeed from allah nothing is hidden in the earth nor in the heaven
it is he who forms you in the wombs however he wills there is no deity except him the exalted in might the wise
it is he who has sent down to you o muhammad the book in it are verses that are precise they are the foundation of the book and others unspecific as for those in whose hearts is deviation from truth they will follow that of it which is unspecific seeking discord and seeking an interpretation suitable to them and no one knows its true interpretation except allah but those firm in knowledge say we believe in it all of it is from our lord and no one will be reminded except those of understanding
who say our lord let not our hearts deviate after you have guided us and grant us from yourself mercy indeed you are the bestower
our lord surely you will gather the people for a day about which there is no doubt indeed allah does not fail in his promise
indeed those who disbelieve never will their wealth or their children avail them against allah at all and it is they who are fuel for the fire
theirs is like the custom of the people of pharaoh and those before them they denied our signs so allah seized them for their sins and allah is severe in penalty
say to those who disbelieve you will be overcome and gathered together to hell and wretched is the resting place
already there has been for you a sign in the two armies which met one fighting in the cause of allah and another of disbelievers they saw them to be twice their own number by their eyesight but allah supports with his victory whom he wills indeed in that is a lesson for those of vision
beautified for people is the love of that which they desire of women and sons heaped up sums of gold and silver fine branded horses and cattle and tilled land that is the enjoyment of worldly life but allah has with him the best return
say shall i inform you of something better than that for those who fear allah will be gardens in the presence of their lord beneath which rivers flow wherein they abide eternally and purified spouses and approval from allah and allah is seeing of his servants
those who say our lord indeed we have believed so forgive us our sins and protect us from the punishment of the fire
the patient the true the obedient those who spend in the way of allah and those who seek forgiveness before dawn
allah witnesses that there is no deity except him and so do the angels and those of knowledge that he is maintaining creation in justice there is no deity except him the exalted in might the wise
indeed the religion in the sight of allah is islam and those who were given the scripture did not differ except after knowledge had come to them out of jealous animosity between themselves and whoever disbelieves in the verses of allah then indeed allah is swift in taking account
so if they argue with you say i have submitted myself to allah in islam and so have those who follow me and say to those who were given the scripture and to the unlearned have you submitted yourselves and if they submit in islam they are rightly guided but if they turn away then upon you is only the duty of notification and allah is seeing of his servants
those who disbelieve in the signs of allah and kill the prophets without right and kill those who order justice from among the people give them tidings of a painful punishment
they are the ones whose deeds have become worthless in this world and the hereafter and for them there will be no helpers
do you not consider o muhammad those who were given a portion of the scripture they are invited to the scripture of allah that it should arbitrate between them then a party of them turns away and they are refusing
that is because they say never will the fire touch us except for a few numbered days and because they were deluded in their religion by what they were inventing
so how will it be when we assemble them for a day about which there is no doubt and each soul will be compensated in full for what it earned and they will not be wronged
say o allah owner of sovereignty you give sovereignty to whom you will and you take sovereignty away from whom you will you honor whom you will and you humble whom you will in your hand is all good indeed you are over all things competent
you cause the night to enter the day and you cause the day to enter the night and you bring the living out of the dead and you bring the dead out of the living and you give provision to whom you will without account
let not believers take disbelievers as allies rather than believers and whoever of you does that has nothing with allah except when taking precaution against them in prudence and allah warns you of himself and to allah is the final destination
say whether you conceal what is in your breasts or reveal it allah knows it and he knows that which is in the heavens and that which is on the earth and allah is over all things competent
the day every soul will find what it has done of good present before it and what it has done of evil it will wish that between itself and that evil was a great distance and allah warns you of himself and allah is kind to his servants
say o muhammad if you should love allah then follow me so allah will love you and forgive you your sins and allah is forgiving and merciful
say obey allah and the messenger but if they turn away then indeed allah does not like the disbelievers
indeed allah chose adam and noah and the family of abraham and the family of imran over the worlds
descendants some of them from others and allah is hearing and knowing
mention o muhammad when the wife of imran said my lord indeed i have pledged to you what is in my womb consecrated for your service so accept this from me indeed you are the hearing the knowing
but when she delivered her she said my lord i have delivered a female and allah was most knowing of what she delivered and the male is not like the female and i have named her mary and i seek refuge for her in you and for her descendants from satan the expelled from the mercy of allah
so her lord accepted her with good acceptance and caused her to grow in a good manner and put her in the care of zechariah every time zechariah entered upon her in the prayer chamber he found with her provision he said o mary from where is this coming to you she said it is from allah indeed allah provides for whom he wills without account
at that zechariah called upon his lord saying my lord grant me from yourself a good offspring indeed you are the hearer of supplication
so the angels called him while he was standing in prayer in the chamber indeed allah gives you good tidings of john confirming a word from allah and who will be honorable abstaining from women and a prophet from among the righteous
he said my lord how will i have a boy when i have reached old age and my wife is barren the angel said such is allah he does what he wills
he said my lord make for me a sign he said your sign is that you will not be able to speak to the people for three days except by gesture and remember your lord much and exalt him with praise in the evening and the morning
and mention when the angels said o mary indeed allah has chosen you and purified you and chosen you above the women of the worlds
o mary be devoutly obedient to your lord and prostrate and bow with those who bow in prayer
that is from the news of the unseen which we reveal to you o muhammad and you were not with them when they cast their pens as to which of them should be responsible for mary nor were you with them when they disputed
and mention when the angels said o mary indeed allah gives you good tidings of a word from him whose name will be the messiah jesus the son of mary distinguished in this world and the hereafter and among those brought near to allah
he will speak to the people in the cradle and in maturity and will be of the righteous
she said my lord how will i have a child when no man has touched me the angel said such is allah he creates what he wills when he decrees a matter he only says to it be and it is
and he will teach him writing and wisdom and the torah and the gospel
and make him a messenger to the children of israel who will say indeed i have come to you with a sign from your lord in that i design for you from clay that which is like the form of a bird then i breathe into it and it becomes a bird by permission of allah and i cure the blind and the leper and i give life to the dead by permission of allah and i inform you of what you eat and what you store in your houses indeed in that is a sign for you if you are believers
and i have come confirming what was before me of the torah and to make lawful for you some of what was forbidden to you and i have come to you with a sign from your lord so fear allah and obey me
indeed allah is my lord and your lord so worship him that is the straight path
but when jesus felt persistence in disbelief from them he said who are my supporters for the cause of allah the disciples said we are supporters for allah we have believed in allah and testify that we are muslims submitting to him
our lord we have believed in what you revealed and have followed the messenger jesus so register us among the witnesses to truth
and the disbelievers planned but allah planned and allah is the best of planners
mention when allah said o jesus indeed i will take you and raise you to myself and purify you from those who disbelieve and make those who follow you in submission to allah alone superior to those who disbelieve until the day of resurrection then to me is your return and i will judge between you concerning that in which you used to differ
and as for those who disbelieved i will punish them with a severe punishment in this world and the hereafter and they will have no helpers
but as for those who believed and did righteous deeds he will give them in full their rewards and allah does not like the wrongdoers
this is what we recite to you o muhammad of our verses and the precise and wise message
indeed the example of jesus to allah is like that of adam he created him from dust then he said to him be and he was
the truth is from your lord so do not be among the doubters
then whoever argues with you about it after this knowledge has come to you say come let us call our sons and your sons our women and your women ourselves and yourselves then supplicate earnestly together and invoke the curse of allah upon the liars among us
indeed this is the true narration and there is no deity except allah and indeed allah is the exalted in might the wise
but if they turn away then indeed allah is knowing of the corrupters
say o people of the scripture come to a word that is equitable between us and you that we will not worship except allah and not associate anything with him and not take one another as lords instead of allah but if they turn away then say bear witness that we are muslims submitting to him
o people of the scripture why do you argue about abraham while the torah and the gospel were not revealed until after him then will you not reason
here you are those who have argued about that of which you have some knowledge but why do you argue about that of which you have no knowledge and allah knows while you know not
abraham was neither a jew nor a christian but he was one inclining toward truth a muslim submitting to allah and he was not of the polytheists
indeed the most worthy of abraham among the people are those who followed him in submission to allah and this prophet and those who believe in his message and allah is the ally of the believers
a faction of the people of the scripture wish they could mislead you but they do not mislead except themselves and they perceive it not
o people of the scripture why do you disbelieve in the verses of allah while you witness to their truth
o people of the scripture why do you confuse the truth with falsehood and conceal the truth while you know it
and a faction of the people of the scripture say to each other believe in that which was revealed to the believers at the beginning of the day and reject it at its end that perhaps they will abandon their religion
and do not trust except those who follow your religion say indeed the true guidance is the guidance of allah do you fear lest someone be given knowledge like you were given or that they would thereby argue with you before your lord say indeed all bounty is in the hand of allah he grants it to whom he wills and allah is all encompassing and wise
he selects for his mercy whom he wills and allah is the possessor of great bounty
and among the people of the scripture is he who if you entrust him with a great amount of wealth he will return it to you and among them is he who if you entrust him with a single silver coin he will not return it to you unless you are constantly standing over him demanding it that is because they say there is no blame upon us concerning the unlearned and they speak untruth about allah while they know it
but yes whoever fulfills his commitment and fears allah then indeed allah loves those who fear him
indeed those who exchange the covenant of allah and their own oaths for a small price will have no share in the hereafter and allah will not speak to them or look at them on the day of resurrection nor will he purify them and they will have a painful punishment
and indeed there is among them a party who alter the scripture with their tongues so you may think it is from the scripture but it is not from the scripture and they say this is from allah but it is not from allah and they speak untruth about allah while they know
it is not for a human prophet that allah should give him the scripture and authority and prophethood and then he would say to the people be servants to me rather than allah but instead he would say be pious scholars of the lord because of what you have taught of the scripture and because of what you have studied
nor could he order you to take the angels and prophets as lords would he order you to disbelief after you had been muslims
and recall o people of the scripture when allah took the covenant of the prophets saying whatever i give you of the scripture and wisdom and then there comes to you a messenger confirming what is with you you must believe in him and support him allah said have you acknowledged and taken upon that my commitment they said we have acknowledged it he said then bear witness and i am with you among the witnesses
and whoever turned away after that they were the defiantly disobedient
so is it other than the religion of allah they desire while to him have submitted all those within the heavens and earth willingly or by compulsion and to him they will be returned
say we have believed in allah and in what was revealed to us and what was revealed to abraham ishmael isaac jacob and the descendants and in what was given to moses and jesus and to the prophets from their lord we make no distinction between any of them and we are muslims submitting to him
and whoever desires other than islam as religion never will it be accepted from him and he in the hereafter will be among the losers
how shall allah guide a people who disbelieved after their belief and had witnessed that the messenger is true and clear signs had come to them and allah does not guide the wrongdoing people
those their recompense will be that upon them is the curse of allah and the angels and the people all together
abiding eternally therein the punishment will not be lightened for them nor will they be reprieved
except for those who repent after that and correct themselves for indeed allah is forgiving and merciful
indeed those who reject the message after their belief and then increase in disbelief never will their claimed repentance be accepted and they are the ones astray
indeed those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers never would the whole capacity of the earth in gold be accepted from one of them if he would seek to ransom himself with it for those there will be a painful punishment and they will have no helpers
never will you attain the good reward until you spend in the way of allah from that which you love and whatever you spend indeed allah is knowing of it
all food was lawful to the children of israel except what israel had made unlawful to himself before the torah was revealed say o muhammad so bring the torah and recite it if you should be truthful
and whoever invents about allah untruth after that then those are truly the wrongdoers
say allah has told the truth so follow the religion of abraham inclining toward truth and he was not of the polytheists
indeed the first house of worship established for mankind was that at makkah blessed and a guidance for the worlds
in it are clear signs such as the standing place of abraham and whoever enters it shall be safe and due to allah from the people is a pilgrimage to the house for whoever is able to find thereto a way but whoever disbelieves then indeed allah is free from need of the worlds
say o people of the scripture why do you disbelieve in the verses of allah while allah is witness over what you do
say o people of the scripture why do you avert from the way of allah those who believe seeking to make it seem deviant while you are witnesses to the truth and allah is not unaware of what you do
o you who have believed if you obey a party of those who were given the scripture they would turn you back after your belief to being unbelievers
and how could you disbelieve while to you are being recited the verses of allah and among you is his messenger and whoever holds firmly to allah has indeed been guided to a straight path
o you who have believed fear allah as he should be feared and do not die except as muslims in submission to him
and hold firmly to the rope of allah all together and do not become divided and remember the favor of allah upon you when you were enemies and he brought your hearts together and you became by his favor brothers and you were on the edge of a pit of the fire and he saved you from it thus does allah make clear to you his verses that you may be guided
and let there be arising from you a nation inviting to all that is good enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong and those will be the successful
and do not be like the ones who became divided and differed after the clear proofs had come to them and those will have a great punishment
on the day some faces will turn white and some faces will turn black as for those whose faces turn black to them it will be said did you disbelieve after your belief then taste the punishment for what you used to reject
but as for those whose faces will turn white they will be within the mercy of allah they will abide therein eternally
these are the verses of allah we recite them to you o muhammad in truth and allah wants no injustice to the worlds
to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth and to allah will all matters be returned
you are the best nation produced as an example for mankind you enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and believe in allah if only the people of the scripture had believed it would have been better for them among them are believers but most of them are defiantly disobedient
they will not harm you except for some annoyance and if they fight you they will show you their backs then they will not be aided
they have been put under humiliation by allah wherever they are overtaken except for a covenant from allah and a rope from the muslims and they have drawn upon themselves anger from allah and have been put under destitution that is because they disbelieved in the verses of allah and killed the prophets without right that is because they disobeyed and habitually transgressed
they are not all the same among the people of the scripture is a community standing in obedience reciting the verses of allah during periods of the night and prostrating in prayer
they believe in allah and the last day and they enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and hasten to good deeds and those are among the righteous
and whatever good they do never will it be removed from them and allah is knowing of the righteous
indeed those who disbelieve never will their wealth or their children avail them against allah at all and those are the companions of the fire they will abide therein eternally
the example of what they spend in this worldly life is like that of a wind containing frost which strikes the harvest of a people who have wronged themselves and destroys it and allah has not wronged them but they wrong themselves
o you who have believed do not take as intimates those other than yourselves for they will not spare you any ruin they wish you would have hardship hatred has already appeared from their mouths and what their breasts conceal is greater we have certainly made clear to you the signs if you will use reason
here you are loving them but they are not loving you while you believe in the scripture all of it and when they meet you they say we believe but when they are alone they bite their fingertips at you in rage say die in your rage indeed allah is knowing of that within the breasts
if good touches you it distresses them but if harm strikes you they rejoice at it and if you are patient and fear allah their plot will not harm you at all indeed allah is encompassing of what they do
and remember when you o muhammad left your family in the morning to post the believers at their stations for the battle of uhud and allah is hearing and knowing
when two parties among you were about to lose courage but allah was their ally and upon allah the believers should rely
and already had allah given you victory at the battle of badr while you were few in number then fear allah perhaps you will be grateful
remember when you said to the believers is it not sufficient for you that your lord should reinforce you with three thousand angels sent down
yes if you remain patient and conscious of allah and the enemy come upon you attacking in rage your lord will reinforce you with five thousand angels having marks of distinction
and allah made it not except as a sign of good tidings for you and to reassure your hearts thereby and victory is not except from allah the exalted in might the wise
that he might cut down a section of the disbelievers or suppress them so that they turn back disappointed
not for you o muhammad but for allah is the decision whether he should cut them down or forgive them or punish them for indeed they are wrongdoers
and to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth he forgives whom he wills and punishes whom he wills and allah is forgiving and merciful
o you who have believed do not consume usury doubled and multiplied but fear allah that you may be successful
and fear the fire which has been prepared for the disbelievers
and obey allah and the messenger that you may obtain mercy
and hasten to forgiveness from your lord and a garden as wide as the heavens and earth prepared for the righteous
who spend in the cause of allah during ease and hardship and who restrain anger and who pardon the people and allah loves the doers of good
and those who when they commit an immorality or wrong themselves by transgression remember allah and seek forgiveness for their sins and who can forgive sins except allah and who do not persist in what they have done while they know
those their reward is forgiveness from their lord and gardens beneath which rivers flow in paradise wherein they will abide eternally and excellent is the reward of the righteous workers
similar situations as yours have passed on before you so proceed throughout the earth and observe how was the end of those who denied
this qur an is a clear statement to all the people and a guidance and instruction for those conscious of allah
so do not weaken and do not grieve and you will be superior if you are true believers
if a wound should touch you there has already touched the opposing people a wound similar to it and these days of varying conditions we alternate among the people so that allah may make evident those who believe and may take to himself from among you martyrs and allah does not like the wrongdoers
and that allah may purify the believers through trials and destroy the disbelievers
or do you think that you will enter paradise while allah has not yet made evident those of you who fight in his cause and made evident those who are steadfast
and you had certainly wished for martyrdom before you encountered it and you have now seen it before you while you were looking on
muhammad is not but a messenger other messengers have passed on before him so if he was to die or be killed would you turn back on your heels to unbelief and he who turns back on his heels will never harm allah at all but allah will reward the grateful
and it is not possible for one to die except by permission of allah at a decree determined and whoever desires the reward of this world we will give him thereof and whoever desires the reward of the hereafter we will give him thereof and we will reward the grateful
and how many a prophet fought and with him fought many religious scholars but they never lost assurance due to what afflicted them in the cause of allah nor did they weaken or submit and allah loves the steadfast
and their words were not but that they said our lord forgive us our sins and the excess committed in our affairs and plant firmly our feet and give us victory over the disbelieving people
so allah gave them the reward of this world and the good reward of the hereafter and allah loves the doers of good
o you who have believed if you obey those who disbelieve they will turn you back on your heels and you will then become losers
but allah is your protector and he is the best of helpers
we will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve for what they have associated with allah of which he had not sent down any authority and their refuge will be the fire and wretched is the residence of the wrongdoers
and allah had certainly fulfilled his promise to you when you were killing the enemy by his permission until the time when you lost courage and fell to disputing about the order given by the prophet and disobeyed after he had shown you that which you love among you are some who desire this world and among you are some who desire the hereafter then he turned you back from them defeated that he might test you and he has already forgiven you and allah is the possessor of bounty for the believers
remember when you fled and climbed the mountain without looking aside at anyone while the messenger was calling you from behind so allah repaid you with distress upon distress so you would not grieve for that which had escaped you of victory and spoils of war or for that which had befallen you of injury and death and allah is fully acquainted with what you do
then after distress he sent down upon you security in the form of drowsiness overcoming a faction of you while another faction worried about themselves thinking of allah other than the truth the thought of ignorance saying is there anything for us to have done in this matter say indeed the matter belongs completely to allah they conceal within themselves what they will not reveal to you they say if there was anything we could have done in the matter some of us would not have been killed right here say even if you had been inside your houses those decreed to be killed would have come out to their death beds it was so that allah might test what is in your breasts and purify what is in your hearts and allah is knowing of that within the breasts
indeed those of you who turned back on the day the two armies met it was satan who caused them to slip because of some blame they had earned but allah has already forgiven them indeed allah is forgiving and forbearing
o you who have believed do not be like those who disbelieved and said about their brothers when they traveled through the land or went out to fight if they had been with us they would not have died or have been killed so allah makes that misconception a regret within their hearts and it is allah who gives life and causes death and allah is seeing of what you do
and if you are killed in the cause of allah or die then forgiveness from allah and mercy are better than whatever they accumulate in this world
and whether you die or are killed unto allah you will be gathered
so by mercy from allah o muhammad you were lenient with them and if you had been rude in speech and harsh in heart they would have disbanded from about you so pardon them and ask forgiveness for them and consult them in the matter and when you have decided then rely upon allah indeed allah loves those who rely upon him
if allah should aid you no one can overcome you but if he should forsake you who is there that can aid you after him and upon allah let the believers rely
it is not attributable to any prophet that he would act unfaithfully in regard to war booty and whoever betrays taking unlawfully will come with what he took on the day of resurrection then will every soul be fully compensated for what it earned and they will not be wronged
so is one who pursues the pleasure of allah like one who brings upon himself the anger of allah and whose refuge is hell and wretched is the destination
they are varying degrees in the sight of allah and allah is seeing of whatever they do
certainly did allah confer great favor upon the believers when he sent among them a messenger from themselves reciting to them his verses and purifying them and teaching them the book and wisdom although they had been before in manifest error
why is it that when a single disaster struck you on the day of uhud although you had struck the enemy in the battle of badr with one twice as great you said from where is this say it is from yourselves indeed allah is over all things competent
and what struck you on the day the two armies met was by permission of allah that he might make evident the true believers
and that he might make evident those who are hypocrites for it was said to them come fight in the way of allah or at least defend they said if we had known there would be fighting we would have followed you they were nearer to disbelief that day than to faith saying with their mouths what was not in their hearts and allah is most knowing of what they conceal
those who said about their brothers while sitting at home if they had obeyed us they would not have been killed say then prevent death from yourselves if you should be truthful
and never think of those who have been killed in the cause of allah as dead rather they are alive with their lord receiving provision
rejoicing in what allah has bestowed upon them of his bounty and they receive good tidings about those to be martyred after them who have not yet joined them that there will be no fear concerning them nor will they grieve
they receive good tidings of favor from allah and bounty and of the fact that allah does not allow the reward of believers to be lost
those believers who responded to allah and the messenger after injury had struck them for those who did good among them and feared allah is a great reward
those to whom hypocrites said indeed the people have gathered against you so fear them but it merely increased them in faith and they said sufficient for us is allah and he is the best disposer of affairs
so they returned with favor from allah and bounty no harm having touched them and they pursued the pleasure of allah and allah is the possessor of great bounty
that is only satan who frightens you of his supporters so fear them not but fear me if you are indeed believers
and do not be grieved o muhammad by those who hasten into disbelief indeed they will never harm allah at all allah intends that he should give them no share in the hereafter and for them is a great punishment
indeed those who purchase disbelief in exchange for faith never will they harm allah at all and for them is a painful punishment
and let not those who disbelieve ever think that because we extend their time of enjoyment it is better for them we only extend it for them so that they may increase in sin and for them is a humiliating punishment
allah would not leave the believers in that state you are in presently until he separates the evil from the good nor would allah reveal to you the unseen but instead allah chooses of his messengers whom he wills so believe in allah and his messengers and if you believe and fear him then for you is a great reward
and let not those who greedily withhold what allah has given them of his bounty ever think that it is better for them rather it is worse for them their necks will be encircled by what they withheld on the day of resurrection and to allah belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth and allah with what you do is fully acquainted
allah has certainly heard the statement of those jews who said indeed allah is poor while we are rich we will record what they said and their killing of the prophets without right and will say taste the punishment of the burning fire
that is for what your hands have put forth and because allah is not ever unjust to his servants
they are those who said indeed allah has taken our promise not to believe any messenger until he brings us an offering which fire from heaven will consume say there have already come to you messengers before me with clear proofs and even that of which you speak so why did you kill them if you should be truthful
then if they deny you o muhammad so were messengers denied before you who brought clear proofs and written ordinances and the enlightening scripture
every soul will taste death and you will only be given your full compensation on the day of resurrection so he who is drawn away from the fire and admitted to paradise has attained his desire and what is the life of this world except the enjoyment of delusion
you will surely be tested in your possessions and in yourselves and you will surely hear from those who were given the scripture before you and from those who associate others with allah much abuse but if you are patient and fear allah indeed that is of the matters worthy of determination
and mention o muhammad when allah took a covenant from those who were given the scripture saying you must make it clear to the people and not conceal it but they threw it away behind their backs and exchanged it for a small price and wretched is that which they purchased
and never think that those who rejoice in what they have perpetrated and like to be praised for what they did not do never think them to be in safety from the punishment and for them is a painful punishment
and to allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and allah is over all things competent
indeed in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the night and the day are signs for those of understanding
who remember allah while standing or sitting or lying on their sides and give thought to the creation of the heavens and the earth saying our lord you did not create this aimlessly exalted are you above such a thing then protect us from the punishment of the fire
our lord indeed whoever you admit to the fire you have disgraced him and for the wrongdoers there are no helpers
our lord indeed we have heard a caller calling to faith saying believe in your lord and we have believed our lord so forgive us our sins and remove from us our misdeeds and cause us to die with the righteous
our lord and grant us what you promised us through your messengers and do not disgrace us on the day of resurrection indeed you do not fail in your promise
and their lord responded to them never will i allow to be lost the work of any worker among you whether male or female you are of one another so those who emigrated or were evicted from their homes or were harmed in my cause or fought or were killed i will surely remove from them their misdeeds and i will surely admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow as reward from allah and allah has with him the best reward
be not deceived by the uninhibited movement of the disbelievers throughout the land
it is but a small enjoyment then their final refuge is hell and wretched is the resting place
but those who feared their lord will have gardens beneath which rivers flow abiding eternally therein as accommodation from allah and that which is with allah is best for the righteous
and indeed among the people of the scripture are those who believe in allah and what was revealed to you and what was revealed to them being humbly submissive to allah they do not exchange the verses of allah for a small price those will have their reward with their lord indeed allah is swift in account
o you who have believed persevere and endure and remain stationed and fear allah that you may be successful
o mankind fear your lord who created you from one soul and created from it its mate and dispersed from both of them many men and women and fear allah through whom you ask one another and the wombs indeed allah is ever over you an observer
and give to the orphans their properties and do not substitute the defective of your own for the good of theirs and do not consume their properties into your own indeed that is ever a great sin
and if you fear that you will not deal justly with the orphan girls then marry those that please you of other women two or three or four but if you fear that you will not be just then marry only one or those your right hand possesses that is more suitable that you may not incline to injustice
and give the women upon marriage their bridal gifts graciously but if they give up willingly to you anything of it then take it in satisfaction and ease
and do not give the weak minded your property which allah has made a means of sustenance for you but provide for them with it and clothe them and speak to them words of appropriate kindness
and test the orphans in their abilities until they reach marriageable age then if you perceive in them sound judgement release their property to them and do not consume it excessively and quickly anticipating that they will grow up and whoever when acting as guardian is self sufficient should refrain from taking a fee and whoever is poor let him take according to what is acceptable then when you release their property to them bring witnesses upon them and sufficient is allah as accountant
for men is a share of what the parents and close relatives leave and for women is a share of what the parents and close relatives leave be it little or much an obligatory share
and when other relatives and orphans and the needy are present at the time of division then provide for them something out of the estate and speak to them words of appropriate kindness
and let those executors and guardians fear injustice as if they themselves had left weak offspring behind and feared for them so let them fear allah and speak words of appropriate justice
indeed those who devour the property of orphans unjustly are only consuming into their bellies fire and they will be burned in a blaze
allah instructs you concerning your children for the male what is equal to the share of two females but if there are only daughters two or more for them is two thirds of one s estate and if there is only one for her is half and for one s parents to each one of them is a sixth of his estate if he left children but if he had no children and the parents alone inherit from him then for his mother is one third and if he had brothers or sisters for his mother is a sixth after any bequest he may have made or debt your parents or your children you know not which of them are nearest to you in benefit these shares are an obligation imposed by allah indeed allah is ever knowing and wise
and for you is half of what your wives leave if they have no child but if they have a child for you is one fourth of what they leave after any bequest they may have made or debt and for the wives is one fourth if you leave no child but if you leave a child then for them is an eighth of what you leave after any bequest you may have made or debt and if a man or woman leaves neither ascendants nor descendants but has a brother or a sister then for each one of them is a sixth but if they are more than two they share a third after any bequest which was made or debt as long as there is no detriment caused this is an ordinance from allah and allah is knowing and forbearing
these are the limits set by allah and whoever obeys allah and his messenger will be admitted by him to gardens in paradise under which rivers flow abiding eternally therein and that is the great attainment
and whoever disobeys allah and his messenger and transgresses his limits he will put him into the fire to abide eternally therein and he will have a humiliating punishment
those who commit unlawful sexual intercourse of your women bring against them four witnesses from among you and if they testify confine the guilty women to houses until death takes them or allah ordains for them another way
and the two who commit it among you dishonor them both but if they repent and correct themselves leave them alone indeed allah is ever accepting of repentance and merciful
the repentance accepted by allah is only for those who do wrong in ignorance or carelessness and then repent soon after it is those to whom allah will turn in forgiveness and allah is ever knowing and wise
but repentance is not accepted of those who continue to do evil deeds up until when death comes to one of them he says indeed i have repented now or of those who die while they are disbelievers for them we have prepared a painful punishment
o you who have believed it is not lawful for you to inherit women by compulsion and do not make difficulties for them in order to take back part of what you gave them unless they commit a clear immorality and live with them in kindness for if you dislike them perhaps you dislike a thing and allah makes therein much good
but if you want to replace one wife with another and you have given one of them a great amount in gifts do not take back from it anything would you take it in injustice and manifest sin
and how could you take it while you have gone in unto each other and they have taken from you a solemn covenant
and do not marry those women whom your fathers married except what has already occurred indeed it was an immorality and hateful to allah and was evil as a way
prohibited to you for marriage are your mothers your daughters your sisters your father s sisters your mother s sisters your brother s daughters your sister s daughters your milk mothers who nursed you your sisters through nursing your wives mothers and your step daughters under your guardianship born of your wives unto whom you have gone in but if you have not gone in unto them there is no sin upon you and also prohibited are the wives of your sons who are from your own loins and that you take in marriage two sisters simultaneously except for what has already occurred indeed allah is ever forgiving and merciful
and also prohibited to you are all married women except those your right hands possess this is the decree of allah upon you and lawful to you are all others beyond these provided that you seek them in marriage with gifts from your property desiring chastity not unlawful sexual intercourse so for whatever you enjoy of marriage from them give them their due compensation as an obligation and there is no blame upon you for what you mutually agree to beyond the obligation indeed allah is ever knowing and wise
and whoever among you cannot find the means to marry free believing women then he may marry from those whom your right hands possess of believing slave girls and allah is most knowing about your faith you believers are of one another so marry them with the permission of their people and give them their due compensation according to what is acceptable they should be chaste neither of those who commit unlawful intercourse randomly nor those who take secret lovers but once they are sheltered in marriage if they should commit adultery then for them is half the punishment for free unmarried women this allowance is for him among you who fears sin but to be patient is better for you and allah is forgiving and merciful
allah wants to make clear to you the lawful from the unlawful and guide you to the good practices of those before you and to accept your repentance and allah is knowing and wise
allah wants to accept your repentance but those who follow their passions want you to digress into a great deviation
and allah wants to lighten for you your difficulties and mankind was created weak
o you who have believed do not consume one another s wealth unjustly but only in lawful business by mutual consent and do not kill yourselves or one another indeed allah is to you ever merciful
and whoever does that in aggression and injustice then we will drive him into a fire and that for allah is always easy
if you avoid the major sins which you are forbidden we will remove from you your lesser sins and admit you to a noble entrance into paradise
and do not wish for that by which allah has made some of you exceed others for men is a share of what they have earned and for women is a share of what they have earned and ask allah of his bounty indeed allah is ever of all things knowing
and for all we have made heirs to what is left by parents and relatives and to those whom your oaths have bound to you give them their share indeed allah is ever over all things a witness
men are in charge of women by right of what allah has given one over the other and what they spend for maintenance from their wealth so righteous women are devoutly obedient guarding in the husband s absence what allah would have them guard but those wives from whom you fear arrogance first advise them then if they persist forsake them in bed and finally strike them but if they obey you once more seek no means against them indeed allah is ever exalted and grand
and if you fear dissension between the two send an arbitrator from his people and an arbitrator from her people if they both desire reconciliation allah will cause it between them indeed allah is ever knowing and acquainted with all things
worship allah and associate nothing with him and to parents do good and to relatives orphans the needy the near neighbor the neighbor farther away the companion at your side the traveler and those whom your right hands possess indeed allah does not like those who are self deluding and boastful
who are stingy and enjoin upon other people stinginess and conceal what allah has given them of his bounty and we have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment
and also those who spend of their wealth to be seen by the people and believe not in allah nor in the last day and he to whom satan is a companion then evil is he as a companion
and what harm would come upon them if they believed in allah and the last day and spent out of what allah provided for them and allah is ever about them knowing
indeed allah does not do injustice even as much as an atom s weight while if there is a good deed he multiplies it and gives from himself a great reward
so how will it be when we bring from every nation a witness and we bring you o muhammad against these people as a witness
that day those who disbelieved and disobeyed the messenger will wish they could be covered by the earth and they will not conceal from allah a single statement
o you who have believed do not approach prayer while you are intoxicated until you know what you are saying or in a state of janabah except those passing through a place of prayer until you have washed your whole body and if you are ill or on a journey or one of you comes from the place of relieving himself or you have contacted women and find no water then seek clean earth and wipe over your faces and your hands with it indeed allah is ever pardoning and forgiving
have you not seen those who were given a portion of the scripture purchasing error in exchange for it and wishing you would lose the way
and allah is most knowing of your enemies and sufficient is allah as an ally and sufficient is allah as a helper
among the jews are those who distort words from their proper usages and say we hear and disobey and hear but be not heard and ra ina twisting their tongues and defaming the religion and if they had said instead we hear and obey and wait for us to understand it would have been better for them and more suitable but allah has cursed them for their disbelief so they believe not except for a few
o you who were given the scripture believe in what we have sent down to muhammad confirming that which is with you before we obliterate faces and turn them toward their backs or curse them as we cursed the sabbath breakers and ever is the decree of allah accomplished
indeed allah does not forgive association with him but he forgives what is less than that for whom he wills and he who associates others with allah has certainly fabricated a tremendous sin
have you not seen those who claim themselves to be pure rather allah purifies whom he wills and injustice is not done to them even as much as a thread inside a date seed
look how they invent about allah untruth and sufficient is that as a manifest sin
have you not seen those who were given a portion of the scripture who believe in superstition and false objects of worship and say about the disbelievers these are better guided than the believers as to the way
those are the ones whom allah has cursed and he whom allah curses never will you find for him a helper
or have they a share of dominion then if that were so they would not give the people even as much as the speck on a date seed
or do they envy people for what allah has given them of his bounty but we had already given the family of abraham the scripture and wisdom and conferred upon them a great kingdom
and some among them believed in it and some among them were averse to it and sufficient is hell as a blaze
indeed those who disbelieve in our verses we will drive them into a fire every time their skins are roasted through we will replace them with other skins so they may taste the punishment indeed allah is ever exalted in might and wise
but those who believe and do righteous deeds we will admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow wherein they abide forever for them therein are purified spouses and we will admit them to deepening shade
indeed allah commands you to render trusts to whom they are due and when you judge between people to judge with justice excellent is that which allah instructs you indeed allah is ever hearing and seeing
o you who have believed obey allah and obey the messenger and those in authority among you and if you disagree over anything refer it to allah and the messenger if you should believe in allah and the last day that is the best way and best in result
have you not seen those who claim to have believed in what was revealed to you o muhammad and what was revealed before you they wish to refer legislation to taghut while they were commanded to reject it and satan wishes to lead them far astray
and when it is said to them come to what allah has revealed and to the messenger you see the hypocrites turning away from you in aversion
so how will it be when disaster strikes them because of what their hands have put forth and then they come to you swearing by allah we intended nothing but good conduct and accommodation
those are the ones of whom allah knows what is in their hearts so turn away from them but admonish them and speak to them a far reaching word
and we did not send any messenger except to be obeyed by permission of allah and if when they wronged themselves they had come to you o muhammad and asked forgiveness of allah and the messenger had asked forgiveness for them they would have found allah accepting of repentance and merciful
but no by your lord they will not truly believe until they make you o muhammad judge concerning that over which they dispute among themselves and then find within themselves no discomfort from what you have judged and submit in full willing submission
and if we had decreed upon them kill yourselves or leave your homes they would not have done it except for a few of them but if they had done what they were instructed it would have been better for them and a firmer position for them in faith
and then we would have given them from us a great reward
and we would have guided them to a straight path
and whoever obeys allah and the messenger those will be with the ones upon whom allah has bestowed favor of the prophets the steadfast affirmers of truth the martyrs and the righteous and excellent are those as companions
that is the bounty from allah and sufficient is allah as knower
o you who have believed take your precaution and either go forth in companies or go forth all together
and indeed there is among you he who lingers behind and if disaster strikes you he says allah has favored me in that i was not present with them
but if bounty comes to you from allah he will surely say as if there had never been between you and him any affection oh i wish i had been with them so i could have attained a great attainment
so let those fight in the cause of allah who sell the life of this world for the hereafter and he who fights in the cause of allah and is killed or achieves victory we will bestow upon him a great reward
and what is the matter with you that you fight not in the cause of allah and for the oppressed among men women and children who say our lord take us out of this city of oppressive people and appoint for us from yourself a protector and appoint for us from yourself a helper
those who believe fight in the cause of allah and those who disbelieve fight in the cause of taghut so fight against the allies of satan indeed the plot of satan has ever been weak
have you not seen those who were told restrain your hands from fighting and establish prayer and give zakah but then when fighting was ordained for them at once a party of them feared men as they fear allah or with even greater fear they said our lord why have you decreed upon us fighting if only you had postponed it for us for a short time say the enjoyment of this world is little and the hereafter is better for he who fears allah and injustice will not be done to you even as much as a thread inside a date seed
wherever you may be death will overtake you even if you should be within towers of lofty construction but if good comes to them they say this is from allah and if evil befalls them they say this is from you say all things are from allah so what is the matter with those people that they can hardly understand any statement
what comes to you of good is from allah but what comes to you of evil o man is from yourself and we have sent you o muhammad to the people as a messenger and sufficient is allah as witness
he who obeys the messenger has obeyed allah but those who turn away we have not sent you over them as a guardian
and they say we pledge obedience but when they leave you a group of them spend the night determining to do other than what you say but allah records what they plan by night so leave them alone and rely upon allah and sufficient is allah as disposer of affairs
then do they not reflect upon the qur an if it had been from any other than allah they would have found within it much contradiction
and when there comes to them information about public security or fear they spread it around but if they had referred it back to the messenger or to those of authority among them then the ones who can draw correct conclusions from it would have known about it and if not for the favor of allah upon you and his mercy you would have followed satan except for a few
so fight o muhammad in the cause of allah you are not held responsible except for yourself and encourage the believers to join you that perhaps allah will restrain the military might of those who disbelieve and allah is greater in might and stronger in exemplary punishment
whoever intercedes for a good cause will have a reward therefrom and whoever intercedes for an evil cause will have a burden therefrom and ever is allah over all things a keeper
and when you are greeted with a greeting greet in return with one better than it or at least return it in a like manner indeed allah is ever over all things an accountant
allah there is no deity except him he will surely assemble you for account on the day of resurrection about which there is no doubt and who is more truthful than allah in statement
what is the matter with you that you are two groups concerning the hypocrites while allah has made them fall back into error and disbelief for what they earned do you wish to guide those whom allah has sent astray and he whom allah sends astray never will you find for him a way of guidance
they wish you would disbelieve as they disbelieved so you would be alike so do not take from among them allies until they emigrate for the cause of allah but if they turn away then seize them and kill them wherever you find them and take not from among them any ally or helper
except for those who take refuge with a people between yourselves and whom is a treaty or those who come to you their hearts strained at the prospect of fighting you or fighting their own people and if allah had willed he could have given them power over you and they would have fought you so if they remove themselves from you and do not fight you and offer you peace then allah has not made for you a cause for fighting against them
you will find others who wish to obtain security from you and to obtain security from their people every time they are returned to the influence of disbelief they fall back into it so if they do not withdraw from you or offer you peace or restrain their hands then seize them and kill them wherever you overtake them and those we have made for you against them a clear authorization
and never is it for a believer to kill a believer except by mistake and whoever kills a believer by mistake then the freeing of a believing slave and a compensation payment presented to the deceased s family is required unless they give up their right as charity but if the deceased was from a people at war with you and he was a believer then only the freeing of a believing slave and if he was from a people with whom you have a treaty then a compensation payment presented to his family and the freeing of a believing slave and whoever does not find one or cannot afford to buy one then instead a fast for two months consecutively seeking acceptance of repentance from allah and allah is ever knowing and wise
but whoever kills a believer intentionally his recompense is hell wherein he will abide eternally and allah has become angry with him and has cursed him and has prepared for him a great punishment
o you who have believed when you go forth to fight in the cause of allah investigate and do not say to one who gives you a greeting of peace you are not a believer aspiring for the goods of worldly life for with allah are many acquisitions you yourselves were like that before then allah conferred his favor upon you so investigate indeed allah is ever with what you do acquainted
not equal are those believers remaining at home other than the disabled and the mujahideen who strive and fight in the cause of allah with their wealth and their lives allah has preferred the mujahideen through their wealth and their lives over those who remain behind by degrees and to both allah has promised the best reward but allah has preferred the mujahideen over those who remain behind with a great reward
degrees of high position from him and forgiveness and mercy and allah is ever forgiving and merciful
indeed those whom the angels take in death while wronging themselves the angels will say in what condition were you they will say we were oppressed in the land the angels will say was not the earth of allah spacious enough for you to emigrate therein for those their refuge is hell and evil it is as a destination
except for the oppressed among men women and children who cannot devise a plan nor are they directed to a way
for those it is expected that allah will pardon them and allah is ever pardoning and forgiving
and whoever emigrates for the cause of allah will find on the earth many alternative locations and abundance and whoever leaves his home as an emigrant to allah and his messenger and then death overtakes him his reward has already become incumbent upon allah and allah is ever forgiving and merciful
and when you travel throughout the land there is no blame upon you for shortening the prayer especially if you fear that those who disbelieve may disrupt or attack you indeed the disbelievers are ever to you a clear enemy
and when you are among them and lead them in prayer let a group of them stand in prayer with you and let them carry their arms and when they have prostrated let them be in position behind you and have the other group come forward which has not yet prayed and let them pray with you taking precaution and carrying their arms those who disbelieve wish that you would neglect your weapons and your baggage so they could come down upon you in one single attack but there is no blame upon you if you are troubled by rain or are ill for putting down your arms but take precaution indeed allah has prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment
and when you have completed the prayer remember allah standing sitting or lying on your sides but when you become secure re establish regular prayer indeed prayer has been decreed upon the believers a decree of specified times
and do not weaken in pursuit of the enemy if you should be suffering so are they suffering as you are suffering but you expect from allah that which they expect not and allah is ever knowing and wise
indeed we have revealed to you o muhammad the book in truth so you may judge between the people by that which allah has shown you and do not be for the deceitful an advocate
and seek forgiveness of allah indeed allah is ever forgiving and merciful
and do not argue on behalf of those who deceive themselves indeed allah loves not one who is a habitually sinful deceiver
they conceal their evil intentions and deeds from the people but they cannot conceal them from allah and he is with them in his knowledge when they spend the night in such as he does not accept of speech and ever is allah of what they do encompassing
here you are those who argue on their behalf in this worldly life but who will argue with allah for them on the day of resurrection or who will then be their representative
and whoever does a wrong or wrongs himself but then seeks forgiveness of allah will find allah forgiving and merciful
and whoever commits a sin only earns it against himself and allah is ever knowing and wise
but whoever earns an offense or a sin and then blames it on an innocent person has taken upon himself a slander and manifest sin
and if it was not for the favor of allah upon you o muhammad and his mercy a group of them would have determined to mislead you but they do not mislead except themselves and they will not harm you at all and allah has revealed to you the book and wisdom and has taught you that which you did not know and ever has the favor of allah upon you been great
no good is there in much of their private conversation except for those who enjoin charity or that which is right or conciliation between people and whoever does that seeking means to the approval of allah then we are going to give him a great reward
and whoever opposes the messenger after guidance has become clear to him and follows other than the way of the believers we will give him what he has taken and drive him into hell and evil it is as a destination
indeed allah does not forgive association with him but he forgives what is less than that for whom he wills and he who associates others with allah has certainly gone far astray
they call upon instead of him none but female deities and they actually call upon none but a rebellious satan
whom allah has cursed for he had said i will surely take from among your servants a specific portion
and i will mislead them and i will arouse in them sinful desires and i will command them so they will slit the ears of cattle and i will command them so they will change the creation of allah and whoever takes satan as an ally instead of allah has certainly sustained a clear loss
satan promises them and arouses desire in them but satan does not promise them except delusion
the refuge of those will be hell and they will not find from it an escape
but the ones who believe and do righteous deeds we will admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide forever it is the promise of allah which is truth and who is more truthful than allah in statement
paradise is not obtained by your wishful thinking nor by that of the people of the scripture whoever does a wrong will be recompensed for it and he will not find besides allah a protector or a helper
and whoever does righteous deeds whether male or female while being a believer those will enter paradise and will not be wronged even as much as the speck on a date seed
and who is better in religion than one who submits himself to allah while being a doer of good and follows the religion of abraham inclining toward truth and allah took abraham as an intimate friend
and to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth and ever is allah of all things encompassing
and they request from you o muhammad a legal ruling concerning women say allah gives you a ruling about them and about what has been recited to you in the book concerning the orphan girls to whom you do not give what is decreed for them and yet you desire to marry them and concerning the oppressed among children and that you maintain for orphans their rights in justice and whatever you do of good indeed allah is ever knowing of it
and if a woman fears from her husband contempt or evasion there is no sin upon them if they make terms of settlement between them and settlement is best and present in human souls is stinginess but if you do good and fear allah then indeed allah is ever with what you do acquainted
and you will never be able to be equal in feeling between wives even if you should strive to do so so do not incline completely toward one and leave another hanging and if you amend your affairs and fear allah then indeed allah is ever forgiving and merciful
but if they separate by divorce allah will enrich each of them from his abundance and ever is allah encompassing and wise
and to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth and we have instructed those who were given the scripture before you and yourselves to fear allah but if you disbelieve then to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth and ever is allah free of need and praiseworthy
and to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth and sufficient is allah as disposer of affairs
if he wills he can do away with you o people and bring others in your place and ever is allah competent to do that
whoever desires the reward of this world then with allah is the reward of this world and the hereafter and ever is allah hearing and seeing
o you who have believed be persistently standing firm in justice witnesses for allah even if it be against yourselves or parents and relatives whether one is rich or poor allah is more worthy of both so follow not personal inclination lest you not be just and if you distort your testimony or refuse to give it then indeed allah is ever with what you do acquainted
o you who have believed believe in allah and his messenger and the book that he sent down upon his messenger and the scripture which he sent down before and whoever disbelieves in allah his angels his books his messengers and the last day has certainly gone far astray
indeed those who have believed then disbelieved then believed then disbelieved and then increased in disbelief never will allah forgive them nor will he guide them to a way
give tidings to the hypocrites that there is for them a painful punishment
those who take disbelievers as allies instead of the believers do they seek with them honor through power but indeed honor belongs to allah entirely
and it has already come down to you in the book that when you hear the verses of allah recited they are denied by them and ridiculed so do not sit with them until they enter into another conversation indeed you would then be like them indeed allah will gather the hypocrites and disbelievers in hell all together
those who wait and watch you then if you gain a victory from allah they say were we not with you but if the disbelievers have a success they say to them did we not gain the advantage over you but we protected you from the believers allah will judge between all of you on the day of resurrection and never will allah give the disbelievers over the believers a way to overcome them
indeed the hypocrites think to deceive allah but he is deceiving them and when they stand for prayer they stand lazily showing themselves to the people and not remembering allah except a little
wavering between them belonging neither to the believers nor to the disbelievers and whoever allah leaves astray never will you find for him a way
o you who have believed do not take the disbelievers as allies instead of the believers do you wish to give allah against yourselves a clear case
indeed the hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of the fire and never will you find for them a helper
except for those who repent correct themselves hold fast to allah and are sincere in their religion for allah for those will be with the believers and allah is going to give the believers a great reward
what would allah do with your punishment if you are grateful and believe and ever is allah appreciative and knowing
allah does not like the public mention of evil except by one who has been wronged and ever is allah hearing and knowing
if instead you show some good or conceal it or pardon an offense indeed allah is ever pardoning and competent
indeed those who disbelieve in allah and his messengers and wish to discriminate between allah and his messengers and say we believe in some and disbelieve in others and wish to adopt a way in between
those are the disbelievers truly and we have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment
but they who believe in allah and his messengers and do not discriminate between any of them to those he is going to give their rewards and ever is allah forgiving and merciful
the people of the scripture ask you to bring down to them a book from the heaven but they had asked of moses even greater than that and said show us allah outright so the thunderbolt struck them for their wrongdoing then they took the calf for worship after clear evidences had come to them and we pardoned that and we gave moses a clear authority
and we raised over them the mount for refusal of their covenant and we said to them enter the gate bowing humbly and we said to them do not transgress on the sabbath and we took from them a solemn covenant
and we cursed them for their breaking of the covenant and their disbelief in the signs of allah and their killing of the prophets without right and their saying our hearts are wrapped rather allah has sealed them because of their disbelief so they believe not except for a few
and we cursed them for their disbelief and their saying against mary a great slander
and for their saying indeed we have killed the messiah jesus the son of mary the messenger of allah and they did not kill him nor did they crucify him but another was made to resemble him to them and indeed those who differ over it are in doubt about it they have no knowledge of it except the following of assumption and they did not kill him for certain
rather allah raised him to himself and ever is allah exalted in might and wise
and there is none from the people of the scripture but that he will surely believe in jesus before his death and on the day of resurrection he will be against them a witness
for wrongdoing on the part of the jews we made unlawful for them certain good foods which had been lawful to them and for their averting from the way of allah many people
and for their taking of usury while they had been forbidden from it and their consuming of the people s wealth unjustly and we have prepared for the disbelievers among them a painful punishment
but those firm in knowledge among them and the believers believe in what has been revealed to you o muhammad and what was revealed before you and the establishers of prayer especially and the givers of zakah and the believers in allah and the last day those we will give a great reward
indeed we have revealed to you o muhammad as we revealed to noah and the prophets after him and we revealed to abraham ishmael isaac jacob the descendants jesus job jonah aaron and solomon and to david we gave the book of psalms
and we sent messengers about whom we have related their stories to you before and messengers about whom we have not related to you and allah spoke to moses with direct speech
we sent messengers as bringers of good tidings and warners so that mankind will have no argument against allah after the messengers and ever is allah exalted in might and wise
but allah bears witness to that which he has revealed to you he has sent it down with his knowledge and the angels bear witness as well and sufficient is allah as witness
indeed those who disbelieve and avert people from the way of allah have certainly gone far astray
indeed those who disbelieve and commit wrong or injustice never will allah forgive them nor will he guide them to a path
except the path of hell they will abide therein forever and that for allah is always easy
o mankind the messenger has come to you with the truth from your lord so believe it is better for you but if you disbelieve then indeed to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and earth and ever is allah knowing and wise
o people of the scripture do not commit excess in your religion or say about allah except the truth the messiah jesus the son of mary was but a messenger of allah and his word which he directed to mary and a soul created at a command from him so believe in allah and his messengers and do not say three desist it is better for you indeed allah is but one god exalted is he above having a son to him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth and sufficient is allah as disposer of affairs
never would the messiah disdain to be a servant of allah nor would the angels near to him and whoever disdains his worship and is arrogant he will gather them to himself all together
and as for those who believed and did righteous deeds he will give them in full their rewards and grant them extra from his bounty but as for those who disdained and were arrogant he will punish them with a painful punishment and they will not find for themselves besides allah any protector or helper
o mankind there has come to you a conclusive proof from your lord and we have sent down to you a clear light
so those who believe in allah and hold fast to him he will admit them to mercy from himself and bounty and guide them to himself on a straight path
they request from you a legal ruling say allah gives you a ruling concerning one having neither descendants nor ascendants as heirs if a man dies leaving no child but only a sister she will have half of what he left and he inherits from her if she dies and has no child but if there are two sisters or more they will have two thirds of what he left if there are both brothers and sisters the male will have the share of two females allah makes clear to you his law lest you go astray and allah is knowing of all things
o you who have believed fulfill all contracts lawful for you are the animals of grazing livestock except for that which is recited to you in this qur an hunting not being permitted while you are in the state of ihram indeed allah ordains what he intends
o you who have believed do not violate the rites of allah or the sanctity of the sacred month or neglect the marking of the sacrificial animals and garlanding them or violate the safety of those coming to the sacred house seeking bounty from their lord and his approval but when you come out of ihram then you may hunt and do not let the hatred of a people for having obstructed you from al masjid al haram lead you to transgress and cooperate in righteousness and piety but do not cooperate in sin and aggression and fear allah indeed allah is severe in penalty
prohibited to you are dead animals blood the flesh of swine and that which has been dedicated to other than allah and those animals killed by strangling or by a violent blow or by a head long fall or by the goring of horns and those from which a wild animal has eaten except what you are able to slaughter before its death and those which are sacrificed on stone altars and prohibited is that you seek decision through divining arrows that is grave disobedience this day those who disbelieve have despaired of defeating your religion so fear them not but fear me this day i have perfected for you your religion and completed my favor upon you and have approved for you islam as religion but whoever is forced by severe hunger with no inclination to sin then indeed allah is forgiving and merciful
they ask you o muhammad what has been made lawful for them say lawful for you are all good foods and game caught by what you have trained of hunting animals which you train as allah has taught you so eat of what they catch for you and mention the name of allah upon it and fear allah indeed allah is swift in account
this day all good foods have been made lawful and the food of those who were given the scripture is lawful for you and your food is lawful for them and lawful in marriage are chaste women from among the believers and chaste women from among those who were given the scripture before you when you have given them their due compensation desiring chastity not unlawful sexual intercourse or taking secret lovers and whoever denies the faith his work has become worthless and he in the hereafter will be among the losers
o you who have believed when you rise to perform prayer wash your faces and your forearms to the elbows and wipe over your heads and wash your feet to the ankles and if you are in a state of janabah then purify yourselves but if you are ill or on a journey or one of you comes from the place of relieving himself or you have contacted women and do not find water then seek clean earth and wipe over your faces and hands with it allah does not intend to make difficulty for you but he intends to purify you and complete his favor upon you that you may be grateful
and remember the favor of allah upon you and his covenant with which he bound you when you said we hear and we obey and fear allah indeed allah is knowing of that within the breasts
o you who have believed be persistently standing firm for allah witnesses in justice and do not let the hatred of a people prevent you from being just be just that is nearer to righteousness and fear allah indeed allah is acquainted with what you do
allah has promised those who believe and do righteous deeds that for them there is forgiveness and great reward
but those who disbelieve and deny our signs those are the companions of hellfire
o you who have believed remember the favor of allah upon you when a people determined to extend their hands in aggression against you but he withheld their hands from you and fear allah and upon allah let the believers rely
and allah had already taken a covenant from the children of israel and we delegated from among them twelve leaders and allah said i am with you if you establish prayer and give zakah and believe in my messengers and support them and loan allah a goodly loan i will surely remove from you your misdeeds and admit you to gardens beneath which rivers flow but whoever of you disbelieves after that has certainly strayed from the soundness of the way
so for their breaking of the covenant we cursed them and made their hearts hard they distort words from their proper usages and have forgotten a portion of that of which they were reminded and you will still observe deceit among them except a few of them but pardon them and overlook their misdeeds indeed allah loves the doers of good
and from those who say we are christians we took their covenant but they forgot a portion of that of which they were reminded so we caused among them animosity and hatred until the day of resurrection and allah is going to inform them about what they used to do
o people of the scripture there has come to you our messenger making clear to you much of what you used to conceal of the scripture and overlooking much there has come to you from allah a light and a clear book
by which allah guides those who pursue his pleasure to the ways of peace and brings them out from darknesses into the light by his permission and guides them to a straight path
they have certainly disbelieved who say that allah is christ the son of mary say then who could prevent allah at all if he had intended to destroy christ the son of mary or his mother or everyone on the earth and to allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them he creates what he wills and allah is over all things competent
but the jews and the christians say we are the children of allah and his beloved say then why does he punish you for your sins rather you are human beings from among those he has created he forgives whom he wills and he punishes whom he wills and to allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them and to him is the final destination
o people of the scripture there has come to you our messenger to make clear to you the religion after a period of suspension of messengers lest you say there came not to us any bringer of good tidings or a warner but there has come to you a bringer of good tidings and a warner and allah is over all things competent
and mention o muhammad when moses said to his people o my people remember the favor of allah upon you when he appointed among you prophets and made you possessors and gave you that which he had not given anyone among the worlds
o my people enter the holy land which allah has assigned to you and do not turn back from fighting in allah s cause and thus become losers
they said o moses indeed within it is a people of tyrannical strength and indeed we will never enter it until they leave it but if they leave it then we will enter
said two men from those who feared to disobey upon whom allah had bestowed favor enter upon them through the gate for when you have entered it you will be predominant and upon allah rely if you should be believers
they said o moses indeed we will not enter it ever as long as they are within it so go you and your lord and fight indeed we are remaining right here
moses said my lord indeed i do not possess except myself and my brother so part us from the defiantly disobedient people
allah said then indeed it is forbidden to them for forty years in which they will wander throughout the land so do not grieve over the defiantly disobedient people
and recite to them the story of adam s two sons in truth when they both offered a sacrifice to allah and it was accepted from one of them but was not accepted from the other said the latter i will surely kill you said the former indeed allah only accepts from the righteous who fear him
if you should raise your hand against me to kill me i shall not raise my hand against you to kill you indeed i fear allah lord of the worlds
indeed i want you to obtain thereby my sin and your sin so you will be among the companions of the fire and that is the recompense of wrongdoers
and his soul permitted to him the murder of his brother so he killed him and became among the losers
then allah sent a crow searching in the ground to show him how to hide the disgrace of his brother he said o woe to me have i failed to be like this crow and hide the body of my brother and he became of the regretful
because of that we decreed upon the children of israel that whoever kills a soul unless for a soul or for corruption done in the land it is as if he had slain mankind entirely and whoever saves one it is as if he had saved mankind entirely and our messengers had certainly come to them with clear proofs then indeed many of them even after that throughout the land were transgressors
indeed the penalty for those who wage war against allah and his messenger and strive upon earth to cause corruption is none but that they be killed or crucified or that their hands and feet be cut off from opposite sides or that they be exiled from the land that is for them a disgrace in this world and for them in the hereafter is a great punishment
except for those who return repenting before you apprehend them and know that allah is forgiving and merciful
o you who have believed fear allah and seek the means of nearness to him and strive in his cause that you may succeed
indeed those who disbelieve if they should have all that is in the earth and the like of it with it by which to ransom themselves from the punishment of the day of resurrection it will not be accepted from them and for them is a painful punishment
they will wish to get out of the fire but never are they to emerge therefrom and for them is an enduring punishment
as for the thief the male and the female amputate their hands in recompense for what they committed as a deterrent punishment from allah and allah is exalted in might and wise
but whoever repents after his wrongdoing and reforms indeed allah will turn to him in forgiveness indeed allah is forgiving and merciful
do you not know that to allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth he punishes whom he wills and forgives whom he wills and allah is over all things competent
o messenger let them not grieve you who hasten into disbelief of those who say we believe with their mouths but their hearts believe not and from among the jews they are avid listeners to falsehood listening to another people who have not come to you they distort words beyond their proper usages saying if you are given this take it but if you are not given it then beware but he for whom allah intends fitnah never will you possess power to do for him a thing against allah those are the ones for whom allah does not intend to purify their hearts for them in this world is disgrace and for them in the hereafter is a great punishment
they are avid listeners to falsehood devourers of what is unlawful so if they come to you o muhammad judge between them or turn away from them and if you turn away from them never will they harm you at all and if you judge judge between them with justice indeed allah loves those who act justly
but how is it that they come to you for judgement while they have the torah in which is the judgement of allah then they turn away even after that but those are not in fact believers
indeed we sent down the torah in which was guidance and light the prophets who submitted to allah judged by it for the jews as did the rabbis and scholars by that with which they were entrusted of the scripture of allah and they were witnesses thereto so do not fear the people but fear me and do not exchange my verses for a small price and whoever does not judge by what allah has revealed then it is those who are the disbelievers
and we ordained for them therein a life for a life an eye for an eye a nose for a nose an ear for an ear a tooth for a tooth and for wounds is legal retribution but whoever gives up his right as charity it is an expiation for him and whoever does not judge by what allah has revealed then it is those who are the wrongdoers
and we sent following in their footsteps jesus the son of mary confirming that which came before him in the torah and we gave him the gospel in which was guidance and light and confirming that which preceded it of the torah as guidance and instruction for the righteous
and let the people of the gospel judge by what allah has revealed therein and whoever does not judge by what allah has revealed then it is those who are the defiantly disobedient
and we have revealed to you o muhammad the book in truth confirming that which preceded it of the scripture and as a criterion over it so judge between them by what allah has revealed and do not follow their inclinations away from what has come to you of the truth to each of you we prescribed a law and a method had allah willed he would have made you one nation united in religion but he intended to test you in what he has given you so race to all that is good to allah is your return all together and he will then inform you concerning that over which you used to differ
and judge o muhammad between them by what allah has revealed and do not follow their inclinations and beware of them lest they tempt you away from some of what allah has revealed to you and if they turn away then know that allah only intends to afflict them with some of their own sins and indeed many among the people are defiantly disobedient
then is it the judgement of the time of ignorance they desire but who is better than allah in judgement for a people who are certain in faith
o you who have believed do not take the jews and the christians as allies they are in fact allies of one another and whoever is an ally to them among you then indeed he is one of them indeed allah guides not the wrongdoing people
so you see those in whose hearts is disease hastening into association with them saying we are afraid a misfortune may strike us but perhaps allah will bring conquest or a decision from him and they will become over what they have been concealing within themselves regretful
and those who believe will say are these the ones who swore by allah their strongest oaths that indeed they were with you their deeds have become worthless and they have become losers
o you who have believed whoever of you should revert from his religion allah will bring forth in place of them a people he will love and who will love him who are humble toward the believers powerful against the disbelievers they strive in the cause of allah and do not fear the blame of a critic that is the favor of allah he bestows it upon whom he wills and allah is all encompassing and knowing
your ally is none but allah and therefore his messenger and those who have believed those who establish prayer and give zakah and they bow in worship
and whoever is an ally of allah and his messenger and those who have believed indeed the party of allah they will be the predominant
o you who have believed take not those who have taken your religion in ridicule and amusement among the ones who were given the scripture before you nor the disbelievers as allies and fear allah if you should truly be believers
and when you call to prayer they take it in ridicule and amusement that is because they are a people who do not use reason
say o people of the scripture do you resent us except for the fact that we have believed in allah and what was revealed to us and what was revealed before and because most of you are defiantly disobedient
say shall i inform you of what is worse than that as penalty from allah it is that of those whom allah has cursed and with whom he became angry and made of them apes and pigs and slaves of taghut those are worse in position and further astray from the sound way
and when they come to you they say we believe but they have entered with disbelief in their hearts and they have certainly left with it and allah is most knowing of what they were concealing
and you see many of them hastening into sin and aggression and the devouring of what is unlawful how wretched is what they have been doing
why do the rabbis and religious scholars not forbid them from saying what is sinful and devouring what is unlawful how wretched is what they have been practicing
and the jews say the hand of allah is chained chained are their hands and cursed are they for what they say rather both his hands are extended he spends however he wills and that which has been revealed to you from your lord will surely increase many of them in transgression and disbelief and we have cast among them animosity and hatred until the day of resurrection every time they kindled the fire of war against you allah extinguished it and they strive throughout the land causing corruption and allah does not like corrupters
and if only the people of the scripture had believed and feared allah we would have removed from them their misdeeds and admitted them to gardens of pleasure
and if only they upheld the law of the torah the gospel and what has been revealed to them from their lord they would have consumed provision from above them and from beneath their feet among them are a moderate community but many of them evil is that which they do
o messenger announce that which has been revealed to you from your lord and if you do not then you have not conveyed his message and allah will protect you from the people indeed allah does not guide the disbelieving people
say o people of the scripture you are standing on nothing until you uphold the law of the torah the gospel and what has been revealed to you from your lord and that which has been revealed to you from your lord will surely increase many of them in transgression and disbelief so do not grieve over the disbelieving people
indeed those who have believed in prophet muhammad and those before him who were jews or sabeans or christians those among them who believed in allah and the last day and did righteousness no fear will there be concerning them nor will they grieve
we had already taken the covenant of the children of israel and had sent to them messengers whenever there came to them a messenger with what their souls did not desire a party of messengers they denied and another party they killed
and they thought there would be no resulting punishment so they became blind and deaf then allah turned to them in forgiveness then again many of them became blind and deaf and allah is seeing of what they do
they have certainly disbelieved who say allah is the messiah the son of mary while the messiah has said o children of israel worship allah my lord and your lord indeed he who associates others with allah allah has forbidden him paradise and his refuge is the fire and there are not for the wrongdoers any helpers
they have certainly disbelieved who say allah is the third of three and there is no god except one god and if they do not desist from what they are saying there will surely afflict the disbelievers among them a painful punishment
so will they not repent to allah and seek his forgiveness and allah is forgiving and merciful
the messiah son of mary was not but a messenger other messengers have passed on before him and his mother was a supporter of truth they both used to eat food look how we make clear to them the signs then look how they are deluded
say do you worship besides allah that which holds for you no power of harm or benefit while it is allah who is the hearing the knowing
say o people of the scripture do not exceed limits in your religion beyond the truth and do not follow the inclinations of a people who had gone astray before and misled many and have strayed from the soundness of the way
cursed were those who disbelieved among the children of israel by the tongue of david and of jesus the son of mary that was because they disobeyed and habitually transgressed
they used not to prevent one another from wrongdoing that they did how wretched was that which they were doing
you see many of them becoming allies of those who disbelieved how wretched is that which they have put forth for themselves in that allah has become angry with them and in the punishment they will abide eternally
and if they had believed in allah and the prophet and in what was revealed to him they would not have taken them as allies but many of them are defiantly disobedient
you will surely find the most intense of the people in animosity toward the believers to be the jews and those who associate others with allah and you will find the nearest of them in affection to the believers those who say we are christians that is because among them are priests and monks and because they are not arrogant
and when they hear what has been revealed to the messenger you see their eyes overflowing with tears because of what they have recognized of the truth they say our lord we have believed so register us among the witnesses
and why should we not believe in allah and what has come to us of the truth and we aspire that our lord will admit us to paradise with the righteous people
so allah rewarded them for what they said with gardens in paradise beneath which rivers flow wherein they abide eternally and that is the reward of doers of good
but those who disbelieved and denied our signs they are the companions of hellfire
o you who have believed do not prohibit the good things which allah has made lawful to you and do not transgress indeed allah does not like transgressors
and eat of what allah has provided for you which is lawful and good and fear allah in whom you are believers
allah will not impose blame upon you for what is meaningless in your oaths but he will impose blame upon you for breaking what you intended of oaths so its expiation is the feeding of ten needy people from the average of that which you feed your own families or clothing them or the freeing of a slave but whoever cannot find or afford it then a fast of three days is required that is the expiation for oaths when you have sworn but guard your oaths thus does allah make clear to you his verses that you may be grateful
o you who have believed indeed intoxicants gambling sacrificing on stone alters to other than allah and divining arrows are but defilement from the work of satan so avoid it that you may be successful
satan only wants to cause between you animosity and hatred through intoxicants and gambling and to avert you from the remembrance of allah and from prayer so will you not desist
and obey allah and obey the messenger and beware and if you turn away then know that upon our messenger is only the responsibility for clear notification
there is not upon those who believe and do righteousness any blame concerning what they have eaten in the past if they now fear allah and believe and do righteous deeds and then fear allah and believe and then fear allah and do good and allah loves the doers of good
o you who have believed allah will surely test you through something of the game that your hands and spears can reach that allah may make evident those who fear him unseen and whoever transgresses after that for him is a painful punishment
o you who have believed do not kill game while you are in the state of ihram and whoever of you kills it intentionally the penalty is an equivalent from sacrificial animals to what he killed as judged by two just men among you as an offering to allah delivered to the ka bah or an expiation the feeding of needy people or the equivalent of that in fasting that he may taste the consequence of his deed allah has pardoned what is past but whoever returns to violation then allah will take retribution from him and allah is exalted in might and owner of retribution
lawful to you is game from the sea and its food as provision for you and the travelers but forbidden to you is game from the land as long as you are in the state of ihram and fear allah to whom you will be gathered
allah has made the ka bah the sacred house standing for the people and has sanctified the sacred months and the sacrificial animals and the garlands by which they are identified that is so you may know that allah knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth and that allah is knowing of all things
know that allah is severe in penalty and that allah is forgiving and merciful
not upon the messenger is responsibility except for notification and allah knows whatever you reveal and whatever you conceal
say not equal are the evil and the good although the abundance of evil might impress you so fear allah o you of understanding that you may be successful
o you who have believed do not ask about things which if they are shown to you will distress you but if you ask about them while the qur an is being revealed they will be shown to you allah has pardoned that which is past and allah is forgiving and forbearing
a people asked such questions before you then they became thereby disbelievers
allah has not appointed such innovations as bahirah or sa ibah or wasilah or ham but those who disbelieve invent falsehood about allah and most of them do not reason
and when it is said to them come to what allah has revealed and to the messenger they say sufficient for us is that upon which we found our fathers even though their fathers knew nothing nor were they guided
o you who have believed upon you is responsibility for yourselves those who have gone astray will not harm you when you have been guided to allah is you return all together then he will inform you of what you used to do
o you who have believed testimony should be taken among you when death approaches one of you at the time of bequest that of two just men from among you or two others from outside if you are traveling through the land and the disaster of death should strike you detain them after the prayer and let them both swear by allah if you doubt their testimony saying we will not exchange our oath for a price even if he should be a near relative and we will not withhold the testimony of allah indeed we would then be of the sinful
but if it is found that those two were guilty of perjury let two others stand in their place who are foremost in claim from those who have a lawful right and let them swear by allah our testimony is truer than their testimony and we have not transgressed indeed we would then be of the wrongdoers
that is more likely that they will give testimony according to its true objective or at least they would fear that other oaths might be taken after their oaths and fear allah and listen and allah does not guide the defiantly disobedient people
be warned of the day when allah will assemble the messengers and say what was the response you received they will say we have no knowledge indeed it is you who is knower of the unseen
the day when allah will say o jesus son of mary remember my favor upon you and upon your mother when i supported you with the pure spirit and you spoke to the people in the cradle and in maturity and remember when i taught you writing and wisdom and the torah and the gospel and when you designed from clay what was like the form of a bird with my permission then you breathed into it and it became a bird with my permission and you healed the blind and the leper with my permission and when you brought forth the dead with my permission and when i restrained the children of israel from killing you when you came to them with clear proofs and those who disbelieved among them said this is not but obvious magic
and remember when i inspired to the disciples believe in me and in my messenger jesus they said we have believed so bear witness that indeed we are muslims in submission to allah
and remember when the disciples said o jesus son of mary can your lord send down to us a table spread with food from the heaven jesus said fear allah if you should be believers
they said we wish to eat from it and let our hearts be reassured and know that you have been truthful to us and be among its witnesses
said jesus the son of mary o allah our lord send down to us a table spread with food from the heaven to be for us a festival for the first of us and the last of us and a sign from you and provide for us and you are the best of providers
allah said indeed i will sent it down to you but whoever disbelieves afterwards from among you then indeed will i punish him with a punishment by which i have not punished anyone among the worlds
and beware the day when allah will say o jesus son of mary did you say to the people take me and my mother as deities besides allah he will say exalted are you it was not for me to say that to which i have no right if i had said it you would have known it you know what is within myself and i do not know what is within yourself indeed it is you who is knower of the unseen
i said not to them except what you commanded me to worship allah my lord and your lord and i was a witness over them as long as i was among them but when you took me up you were the observer over them and you are over all things witness
if you should punish them indeed they are your servants but if you forgive them indeed it is you who is the exalted in might the wise
allah will say this is the day when the truthful will benefit from their truthfulness for them are gardens in paradise beneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide forever allah being pleased with them and they with him that is the great attainment
to allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is within them and he is over all things competent
all praise is due to allah who created the heavens and the earth and made the darkness and the light then those who disbelieve equate others with their lord
it is he who created you from clay and then decreed a term and a specified time known to him then still you are in dispute
and he is allah the only deity in the heavens and the earth he knows your secret and what you make public and he knows that which you earn
and no sign comes to them from the signs of their lord except that they turn away therefrom
for they had denied the truth when it came to them but there is going to reach them the news of what they used to ridicule
have they not seen how many generations we destroyed before them which we had established upon the earth as we have not established you and we sent rain from the sky upon them in showers and made rivers flow beneath them then we destroyed them for their sins and brought forth after them a generation of others
and even if we had sent down to you o muhammad a written scripture on a page and they touched it with their hands the disbelievers would say this is not but obvious magic
and they say why was there not sent down to him an angel but if we had sent down an angel the matter would have been decided then they would not be reprieved
and if we had made him an angel we would have made him appear as a man and we would have covered them with that in which they cover themselves
and already were messengers ridiculed before you but those who mocked them were enveloped by that which they used to ridicule
say travel through the land then observe how was the end of the deniers
say to whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and earth say to allah he has decreed upon himself mercy he will surely assemble you for the day of resurrection about which there is no doubt those who will lose themselves that day do not believe
and to him belongs that which reposes by night and by day and he is the hearing the knowing
say is it other than allah i should take as a protector creator of the heavens and the earth while it is he who feeds and is not fed say o muhammad indeed i have been commanded to be the first among you who submit to allah and was commanded do not ever be of the polytheists
say indeed i fear if i should disobey my lord the punishment of a tremendous day
he from whom it is averted that day allah has granted him mercy and that is the clear attainment
and if allah should touch you with adversity there is no remover of it except him and if he touches you with good then he is over all things competent
and he is the subjugator over his servants and he is the wise the acquainted with all
say what thing is greatest in testimony say allah is witness between me and you and this qur an was revealed to me that i may warn you thereby and whomever it reaches do you truly testify that with allah there are other deities say i will not testify with you say indeed he is but one god and indeed i am free of what you associate with him
those to whom we have given the scripture recognize it as they recognize their own sons those who will lose themselves in the hereafter do not believe
and who is more unjust than one who invents about allah a lie or denies his verses indeed the wrongdoers will not succeed
and mention o muhammad the day we will gather them all together then we will say to those who associated others with allah where are your partners that you used to claim with him
then there will be no excuse upon examination except they will say by allah our lord we were not those who associated
see how they will lie about themselves and lost from them will be what they used to invent
and among them are those who listen to you but we have placed over their hearts coverings lest they understand it and in their ears deafness and if they should see every sign they will not believe in it even when they come to you arguing with you those who disbelieve say this is not but legends of the former peoples
and they prevent others from him and are themselves remote from him and they do not destroy except themselves but they perceive it not
if you could but see when they are made to stand before the fire and will say oh would that we could be returned to life on earth and not deny the signs of our lord and be among the believers
but what they concealed before has now appeared to them and even if they were returned they would return to that which they were forbidden and indeed they are liars
and they say there is none but our worldly life and we will not be resurrected
if you could but see when they will be made to stand before their lord he will say is this not the truth they will say yes by our lord he will then say so taste the punishment because you used to disbelieve
those will have lost who deny the meeting with allah until when the hour of resurrection comes upon them unexpectedly they will say oh how great is our regret over what we neglected concerning it while they bear their burdens on their backs unquestionably evil is that which they bear
and the worldly life is not but amusement and diversion but the home of the hereafter is best for those who fear allah so will you not reason
we know that you o muhammad are saddened by what they say and indeed they do not call you untruthful but it is the verses of allah that the wrongdoers reject
and certainly were messengers denied before you but they were patient over the effects of denial and they were harmed until our victory came to them and none can alter the words of allah and there has certainly come to you some information about the previous messengers
and if their evasion is difficult for you then if you are able to seek a tunnel into the earth or a stairway into the sky to bring them a sign then do so but if allah had willed he would have united them upon guidance so never be of the ignorant
only those who hear will respond but the dead allah will resurrect them then to him they will be returned
and they say why has a sign not been sent down to him from his lord say indeed allah is able to send down a sign but most of them do not know
and there is no creature on or within the earth or bird that flies with its wings except that they are communities like you we have not neglected in the register a thing then unto their lord they will be gathered
but those who deny our verses are deaf and dumb within darknesses whomever allah wills he leaves astray and whomever he wills he puts him on a straight path
say have you considered if there came to you the punishment of allah or there came to you the hour is it other than allah you would invoke if you should be truthful
no it is him alone you would invoke and he would remove that for which you invoked him if he willed and you would forget what you associate with him
and we have already sent messengers to nations before you o muhammad then we seized them with poverty and hardship that perhaps they might humble themselves to us
then why when our punishment came to them did they not humble themselves but their hearts became hardened and satan made attractive to them that which they were doing
so when they forgot that by which they had been reminded we opened to them the doors of every good thing until when they rejoiced in that which they were given we seized them suddenly and they were then in despair
so the people that committed wrong were eliminated and praise to allah lord of the worlds
say have you considered if allah should take away your hearing and your sight and set a seal upon your hearts which deity other than allah could bring them back to you look how we diversify the verses then they still turn away
say have you considered if the punishment of allah should come to you unexpectedly or manifestly will any be destroyed but the wrongdoing people
and we send not the messengers except as bringers of good tidings and warners so whoever believes and reforms there will be no fear concerning them nor will they grieve
but those who deny our verses the punishment will touch them for their defiant disobedience
say o muhammad i do not tell you that i have the depositories containing the provision of allah or that i know the unseen nor do i tell you that i am an angel i only follow what is revealed to me say is the blind equivalent to the seeing then will you not give thought
and warn by the qur an those who fear that they will be gathered before their lord for them besides him will be no protector and no intercessor that they might become righteous
and do not send away those who call upon their lord morning and afternoon seeking his countenance not upon you is anything of their account and not upon them is anything of your account so were you to send them away you would then be of the wrongdoers
and thus we have tried some of them through others that the disbelievers might say is it these whom allah has favored among us is not allah most knowing of those who are grateful
and when those come to you who believe in our verses say peace be upon you your lord has decreed upon himself mercy that any of you who does wrong out of ignorance and then repents after that and corrects himself indeed he is forgiving and merciful
and thus do we detail the verses and thus the way of the criminals will become evident
say indeed i have been forbidden to worship those you invoke besides allah say i will not follow your desires for i would then have gone astray and i would not be of the rightly guided
say indeed i am on clear evidence from my lord and you have denied it i do not have that for which you are impatient the decision is only for allah he relates the truth and he is the best of deciders
say if i had that for which you are impatient the matter would have been decided between me and you but allah is most knowing of the wrongdoers
and with him are the keys of the unseen none knows them except him and he knows what is on the land and in the sea not a leaf falls but that he knows it and no grain is there within the darknesses of the earth and no moist or dry thing but that it is written in a clear record
and it is he who takes your souls by night and knows what you have committed by day then he revives you therein that a specified term may be fulfilled then to him will be your return then he will inform you about what you used to do
and he is the subjugator over his servants and he sends over you guardian angels until when death comes to one of you our messengers take him and they do not fail in their duties
then they his servants are returned to allah their true lord unquestionably his is the judgement and he is the swiftest of accountants
say who rescues you from the darknesses of the land and sea when you call upon him imploring aloud and privately if he should save us from this crisis we will surely be among the thankful
say it is allah who saves you from it and from every distress then you still associate others with him
say he is the one able to send upon you affliction from above you or from beneath your feet or to confuse you so you become sects and make you taste the violence of one another look how we diversify the signs that they might understand
but your people have denied it while it is the truth say i am not over you a manager
for every happening is a finality and you are going to know
and when you see those who engage in offensive discourse concerning our verses then turn away from them until they enter into another conversation and if satan should cause you to forget then do not remain after the reminder with the wrongdoing people
and those who fear allah are not held accountable for the disbelievers at all but only for a reminder that perhaps they will fear him
and leave those who take their religion as amusement and diversion and whom the worldly life has deluded but remind with the qur an lest a soul be given up to destruction for what it earned it will have other than allah no protector and no intercessor and if it should offer every compensation it would not be taken from it those are the ones who are given to destruction for what they have earned for them will be a drink of scalding water and a painful punishment because they used to disbelieve
say shall we invoke instead of allah that which neither benefits us nor harms us and be turned back on our heels after allah has guided us we would then be like one whom the devils enticed to wander upon the earth confused while he has companions inviting him to guidance calling come to us say indeed the guidance of allah is the only guidance and we have been commanded to submit to the lord of the worlds
and to establish prayer and fear him and it is he to whom you will be gathered
and it is he who created the heavens and earth in truth and the day he says be and it is his word is the truth and his is the dominion on the day the horn is blown he is knower of the unseen and the witnessed and he is the wise the acquainted
and mention o muhammad when abraham said to his father azar do you take idols as deities indeed i see you and your people to be in manifest error
and thus did we show abraham the realm of the heavens and the earth that he would be among the certain in faith
so when the night covered him with darkness he saw a star he said this is my lord but when it set he said i like not those that disappear
and when he saw the moon rising he said this is my lord but when it set he said unless my lord guides me i will surely be among the people gone astray
and when he saw the sun rising he said this is my lord this is greater but when it set he said o my people indeed i am free from what you associate with allah
indeed i have turned my face toward he who created the heavens and the earth inclining toward truth and i am not of those who associate others with allah
and his people argued with him he said do you argue with me concerning allah while he has guided me and i fear not what you associate with him and will not be harmed unless my lord should will something my lord encompasses all things in knowledge then will you not remember
and how should i fear what you associate while you do not fear that you have associated with allah that for which he has not sent down to you any authority so which of the two parties has more right to security if you should know
they who believe and do not mix their belief with injustice those will have security and they are rightly guided
and that was our conclusive argument which we gave abraham against his people we raise by degrees whom we will indeed your lord is wise and knowing
and we gave to abraham isaac and jacob all of them we guided and noah we guided before and among his descendants david and solomon and job and joseph and moses and aaron thus do we reward the doers of good
and zechariah and john and jesus and elias and all were of the righteous
and ishmael and elisha and jonah and lot and all of them we preferred over the worlds
and some among their fathers and their descendants and their brothers and we chose them and we guided them to a straight path
that is the guidance of allah by which he guides whomever he wills of his servants but if they had associated others with allah then worthless for them would be whatever they were doing
those are the ones to whom we gave the scripture and authority and prophethood but if the disbelievers deny it then we have entrusted it to a people who are not therein disbelievers
those are the ones whom allah has guided so from their guidance take an example say i ask of you for this message no payment it is not but a reminder for the worlds
and they did not appraise allah with true appraisal when they said allah did not reveal to a human being anything say who revealed the scripture that moses brought as light and guidance to the people you jews make it into pages disclosing some of it and concealing much and you were taught that which you knew not neither you nor your fathers say allah revealed it then leave them in their empty discourse amusing themselves
and this is a book which we have sent down blessed and confirming what was before it that you may warn the mother of cities and those around it those who believe in the hereafter believe in it and they are maintaining their prayers
and who is more unjust than one who invents a lie about allah or says it has been inspired to me while nothing has been inspired to him and one who says i will reveal something like what allah revealed and if you could but see when the wrongdoers are in the overwhelming pangs of death while the angels extend their hands saying discharge your souls today you will be awarded the punishment of extreme humiliation for what you used to say against allah other than the truth and that you were toward his verses being arrogant
it will be said to them and you have certainly come to us alone as we created you the first time and you have left whatever we bestowed upon you behind you and we do not see with you your intercessors which you claimed that they were among you associates of allah it has all been severed between you and lost from you is what you used to claim
indeed allah is the cleaver of grain and date seeds he brings the living out of the dead and brings the dead out of the living that is allah so how are you deluded
he is the cleaver of daybreak and has made the night for rest and the sun and moon for calculation that is the determination of the exalted in might the knowing
and it is he who placed for you the stars that you may be guided by them through the darknesses of the land and sea we have detailed the signs for a people who know
and it is he who produced you from one soul and gave you a place of dwelling and of storage we have detailed the signs for a people who understand
and it is he who sends down rain from the sky and we produce thereby the growth of all things we produce from it greenery from which we produce grains arranged in layers and from the palm trees of its emerging fruit are clusters hanging low and we produce gardens of grapevines and olives and pomegranates similar yet varied look at each of its fruit when it yields and at its ripening indeed in that are signs for a people who believe
but they have attributed to allah partners the jinn while he has created them and have fabricated for him sons and daughters exalted is he and high above what they describe
he is originator of the heavens and the earth how could he have a son when he does not have a companion and he created all things and he is of all things knowing
that is allah your lord there is no deity except him the creator of all things so worship him and he is disposer of all things
vision perceives him not but he perceives all vision and he is the subtle the acquainted
there has come to you enlightenment from your lord so whoever will see does so for the benefit of his soul and whoever is blind does harm against it and say i am not a guardian over you
and thus do we diversify the verses so the disbelievers will say you have studied and so we may make the qur an clear for a people who know
follow o muhammad what has been revealed to you from your lord there is no deity except him and turn away from those who associate others with allah
but if allah had willed they would not have associated and we have not appointed you over them as a guardian nor are you a manager over them
and do not insult those they invoke other than allah lest they insult allah in enmity without knowledge thus we have made pleasing to every community their deeds then to their lord is their return and he will inform them about what they used to do
and they swear by allah their strongest oaths that if a sign came to them they would surely believe in it say the signs are only with allah and what will make you perceive that even if a sign came they would not believe
and we will turn away their hearts and their eyes just as they refused to believe in it the first time and we will leave them in their transgression wandering blindly
and even if we had sent down to them the angels with the message and the dead spoke to them of it and we gathered together every created thing in front of them they would not believe unless allah should will but most of them of that are ignorant
and thus we have made for every prophet an enemy devils from mankind and jinn inspiring to one another decorative speech in delusion but if your lord had willed they would not have done it so leave them and that which they invent
and it is so the hearts of those who disbelieve in the hereafter will incline toward it and that they will be satisfied with it and that they will commit that which they are committing
say then is it other than allah i should seek as judge while it is he who has revealed to you the book explained in detail and those to whom we previously gave the scripture know that it is sent down from your lord in truth so never be among the doubters
and the word of your lord has been fulfilled in truth and in justice none can alter his words and he is the hearing the knowing
and if you obey most of those upon the earth they will mislead you from the way of allah they follow not except assumption and they are not but falsifying
indeed your lord is most knowing of who strays from his way and he is most knowing of the rightly guided
so eat of that meat upon which the name of allah has been mentioned if you are believers in his verses
and why should you not eat of that upon which the name of allah has been mentioned while he has explained in detail to you what he has forbidden you excepting that to which you are compelled and indeed do many lead others astray through their own inclinations without knowledge indeed your lord he is most knowing of the transgressors
and leave what is apparent of sin and what is concealed thereof indeed those who earn blame for sin will be recompensed for that which they used to commit
and do not eat of that upon which the name of allah has not been mentioned for indeed it is grave disobedience and indeed do the devils inspire their allies among men to dispute with you and if you were to obey them indeed you would be associators of others with him
and is one who was dead and we gave him life and made for him light by which to walk among the people like one who is in darkness never to emerge therefrom thus it has been made pleasing to the disbelievers that which they were doing
and thus we have placed within every city the greatest of its criminals to conspire therein but they conspire not except against themselves and they perceive it not
and when a sign comes to them they say never will we believe until we are given like that which was given to the messengers of allah allah is most knowing of where he places his message there will afflict those who committed crimes debasement before allah and severe punishment for what they used to conspire
so whoever allah wants to guide he expands his breast to contain islam and whoever he wants to misguide he makes his breast tight and constricted as though he were climbing into the sky thus does allah place defilement upon those who do not believe
and this is the path of your lord leading straight we have detailed the verses for a people who remember
for them will be the home of peace with their lord and he will be their protecting friend because of what they used to do
and mention o muhammad the day when he will gather them together and say o company of jinn you have misled many of mankind and their allies among mankind will say our lord some of us made use of others and we have now reached our term which you appointed for us he will say the fire is your residence wherein you will abide eternally except for what allah wills indeed your lord is wise and knowing
and thus will we make some of the wrongdoers allies of others for what they used to earn
o company of jinn and mankind did there not come to you messengers from among you relating to you my verses and warning you of the meeting of this day of yours they will say we bear witness against ourselves and the worldly life had deluded them and they will bear witness against themselves that they were disbelievers
that is because your lord would not destroy the cities for wrongdoing while their people were unaware
and for all are degrees from what they have done and your lord is not unaware of what they do
and your lord is the free of need the possessor of mercy if he wills he can do away with you and give succession after you to whomever he wills just as he produced you from the descendants of another people
indeed what you are promised is coming and you will not cause failure to allah
say o my people work according to your position for indeed i am working and you are going to know who will have succession in the home indeed the wrongdoers will not succeed
and the polytheists assign to allah from that which he created of crops and livestock a share and say this is for allah by their claim and this is for our partners associated with him but what is for their partners does not reach allah while what is for allah this reaches their partners evil is that which they rule
and likewise to many of the polytheists their partners have made to seem pleasing the killing of their children in order to bring about their destruction and to cover them with confusion in their religion and if allah had willed they would not have done so so leave them and that which they invent
and they say these animals and crops are forbidden no one may eat from them except whom we will by their claim and there are those camels whose backs are forbidden by them and those upon which the name of allah is not mentioned all of this an invention of untruth about him he will punish them for what they were inventing
and they say what is in the bellies of these animals is exclusively for our males and forbidden to our females but if it is born dead then all of them have shares therein he will punish them for their description indeed he is wise and knowing
those will have lost who killed their children in foolishness without knowledge and prohibited what allah had provided for them inventing untruth about allah they have gone astray and were not rightly guided
and he it is who causes gardens to grow both trellised and untrellised and palm trees and crops of different kinds of food and olives and pomegranates similar and dissimilar eat of each of its fruit when it yields and give its due zakah on the day of its harvest and be not excessive indeed he does not like those who commit excess
and of the grazing livestock are carriers of burdens and those too small eat of what allah has provided for you and do not follow the footsteps of satan indeed he is to you a clear enemy
they are eight mates of the sheep two and of the goats two say is it the two males he has forbidden or the two females or that which the wombs of the two females contain inform me with knowledge if you should be truthful
and of the camels two and of the cattle two say is it the two males he has forbidden or the two females or that which the wombs of the two females contain or were you witnesses when allah charged you with this then who is more unjust than one who invents a lie about allah to mislead the people by something other than knowledge indeed allah does not guide the wrongdoing people
say i do not find within that which was revealed to me anything forbidden to one who would eat it unless it be a dead animal or blood spilled out or the flesh of swine for indeed it is impure or it be that slaughtered in disobedience dedicated to other than allah but whoever is forced by necessity neither desiring it nor transgressing its limit then indeed your lord is forgiving and merciful
and to those who are jews we prohibited every animal of uncloven hoof and of the cattle and the sheep we prohibited to them their fat except what adheres to their backs or the entrails or what is joined with bone by that we repaid them for their injustice and indeed we are truthful
so if they deny you o muhammad say your lord is the possessor of vast mercy but his punishment cannot be repelled from the people who are criminals
those who associated with allah will say if allah had willed we would not have associated anything and neither would our fathers nor would we have prohibited anything likewise did those before deny until they tasted our punishment say do you have any knowledge that you can produce for us you follow not except assumption and you are not but falsifying
say with allah is the far reaching argument if he had willed he would have guided you all
say o muhammad bring forward your witnesses who will testify that allah has prohibited this and if they testify do not testify with them and do not follow the desires of those who deny our verses and those who do not believe in the hereafter while they equate others with their lord
say come i will recite what your lord has prohibited to you he commands that you not associate anything with him and to parents good treatment and do not kill your children out of poverty we will provide for you and them and do not approach immoralities what is apparent of them and what is concealed and do not kill the soul which allah has forbidden to be killed except by legal right this has he instructed you that you may use reason
and do not approach the orphan s property except in a way that is best until he reaches maturity and give full measure and weight in justice we do not charge any soul except with that within its capacity and when you testify be just even if it concerns a near relative and the covenant of allah fulfill this has he instructed you that you may remember
and moreover this is my path which is straight so follow it and do not follow other ways for you will be separated from his way this has he instructed you that you may become righteous
then we gave moses the scripture making complete our favor upon the one who did good and as a detailed explanation of all things and as guidance and mercy that perhaps in the matter of the meeting with their lord they would believe
and this qur an is a book we have revealed which is blessed so follow it and fear allah that you may receive mercy
we revealed it lest you say the scripture was only sent down to two groups before us but we were of their study unaware
or lest you say if only the scripture had been revealed to us we would have been better guided than they so there has now come to you a clear evidence from your lord and a guidance and mercy then who is more unjust than one who denies the verses of allah and turns away from them we will recompense those who turn away from our verses with the worst of punishment for their having turned away
do they then wait for anything except that the angels should come to them or your lord should come or that there come some of the signs of your lord the day that some of the signs of your lord will come no soul will benefit from its faith as long as it had not believed before or had earned through its faith some good say wait indeed we also are waiting
indeed those who have divided their religion and become sects you o muhammad are not associated with them in anything their affair is only left to allah then he will inform them about what they used to do
whoever comes on the day of judgement with a good deed will have ten times the like thereof to his credit and whoever comes with an evil deed will not be recompensed except the like thereof and they will not be wronged
say indeed my lord has guided me to a straight path a correct religion the way of abraham inclining toward truth and he was not among those who associated others with allah
say indeed my prayer my rites of sacrifice my living and my dying are for allah lord of the worlds
no partner has he and this i have been commanded and i am the first among you of the muslims
say is it other than allah i should desire as a lord while he is the lord of all things and every soul earns not blame except against itself and no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another then to your lord is your return and he will inform you concerning that over which you used to differ
and it is he who has made you successors upon the earth and has raised some of you above others in degrees of rank that he may try you through what he has given you indeed your lord is swift in penalty but indeed he is forgiving and merciful
alif lam meem sad
this is a book revealed to you o muhammad so let there not be in your breast distress therefrom that you may warn thereby and as a reminder to the believers
follow o mankind what has been revealed to you from your lord and do not follow other than him any allies little do you remember
and how many cities have we destroyed and our punishment came to them at night or while they were sleeping at noon
and their declaration when our punishment came to them was only that they said indeed we were wrongdoers
then we will surely question those to whom a message was sent and we will surely question the messengers
then we will surely relate their deeds to them with knowledge and we were not at all absent
and the weighing of deeds that day will be the truth so those whose scales are heavy it is they who will be the successful
and those whose scales are light they are the ones who will lose themselves for what injustice they were doing toward our verses
and we have certainly established you upon the earth and made for you therein ways of livelihood little are you grateful
and we have certainly created you o mankind and given you human form then we said to the angels prostrate to adam so they prostrated except for iblees he was not of those who prostrated
allah said what prevented you from prostrating when i commanded you satan said i am better than him you created me from fire and created him from clay
allah said descend from paradise for it is not for you to be arrogant therein so get out indeed you are of the debased
satan said reprieve me until the day they are resurrected
allah said indeed you are of those reprieved
satan said because you have put me in error i will surely sit in wait for them on your straight path
then i will come to them from before them and from behind them and on their right and on their left and you will not find most of them grateful to you
allah said get out of paradise reproached and expelled whoever follows you among them i will surely fill hell with you all together
and o adam dwell you and your wife in paradise and eat from wherever you will but do not approach this tree lest you be among the wrongdoers
but satan whispered to them to make apparent to them that which was concealed from them of their private parts he said your lord did not forbid you this tree except that you become angels or become of the immortal
and he swore by allah to them indeed i am to you from among the sincere advisors
so he made them fall through deception and when they tasted of the tree their private parts became apparent to them and they began to fasten together over themselves from the leaves of paradise and their lord called to them did i not forbid you from that tree and tell you that satan is to you a clear enemy
they said our lord we have wronged ourselves and if you do not forgive us and have mercy upon us we will surely be among the losers
allah said descend being to one another enemies and for you on the earth is a place of settlement and enjoyment for a time
he said therein you will live and therein you will die and from it you will be brought forth
o children of adam we have bestowed upon you clothing to conceal your private parts and as adornment but the clothing of righteousness that is best that is from the signs of allah that perhaps they will remember
o children of adam let not satan tempt you as he removed your parents from paradise stripping them of their clothing to show them their private parts indeed he sees you he and his tribe from where you do not see them indeed we have made the devils allies to those who do not believe
and when they commit an immorality they say we found our fathers doing it and allah has ordered us to do it say indeed allah does not order immorality do you say about allah that which you do not know
say o muhammad my lord has ordered justice and that you maintain yourselves in worship of him at every place or time of prostration and invoke him sincere to him in religion just as he originated you you will return to life
a group of you he guided and a group deserved to be in error indeed they had taken the devils as allies instead of allah while they thought that they were guided
o children of adam take your adornment at every masjid and eat and drink but be not excessive indeed he likes not those who commit excess
say who has forbidden the adornment of allah which he has produced for his servants and the good lawful things of provision say they are for those who believe during the worldly life but exclusively for them on the day of resurrection thus do we detail the verses for a people who know
say my lord has only forbidden immoralities what is apparent of them and what is concealed and sin and oppression without right and that you associate with allah that for which he has not sent down authority and that you say about allah that which you do not know
and for every nation is a specified term so when their time has come they will not remain behind an hour nor will they precede it
o children of adam if there come to you messengers from among you relating to you my verses then whoever fears allah and reforms there will be no fear concerning them nor will they grieve
but the ones who deny our verses and are arrogant toward them those are the companions of the fire they will abide therein eternally
and who is more unjust than one who invents about allah a lie or denies his verses those will attain their portion of the decree until when our messengers come to them to take them in death they will say where are those you used to invoke besides allah they will say they have departed from us and will bear witness against themselves that they were disbelievers
allah will say enter among nations which had passed on before you of jinn and mankind into the fire every time a nation enters it will curse its sister until when they have all overtaken one another therein the last of them will say about the first of them our lord these had misled us so give them a double punishment of the fire he will say for each is double but you do not know
and the first of them will say to the last of them then you had not any favor over us so taste the punishment for what you used to earn
indeed those who deny our verses and are arrogant toward them the gates of heaven will not be opened for them nor will they enter paradise until a camel enters into the eye of a needle and thus do we recompense the criminals
they will have from hell a bed and over them coverings of fire and thus do we recompense the wrongdoers
but those who believed and did righteous deeds we charge no soul except within its capacity those are the companions of paradise they will abide therein eternally
and we will have removed whatever is within their breasts of resentment while flowing beneath them are rivers and they will say praise to allah who has guided us to this and we would never have been guided if allah had not guided us certainly the messengers of our lord had come with the truth and they will be called this is paradise which you have been made to inherit for what you used to do
and the companions of paradise will call out to the companions of the fire we have already found what our lord promised us to be true have you found what your lord promised to be true they will say yes then an announcer will announce among them the curse of allah shall be upon the wrongdoers
who averted people from the way of allah and sought to make it seem deviant while they were concerning the hereafter disbelievers
and between them will be a partition and on its elevations are men who recognize all by their mark and they call out to the companions of paradise peace be upon you they have not yet entered it but they long intensely
and when their eyes are turned toward the companions of the fire they say our lord do not place us with the wrongdoing people
and the companions of the elevations will call to men within hell whom they recognize by their mark saying of no avail to you was your gathering and the fact that you were arrogant
allah will say are these the ones whom you inhabitants of hell swore that allah would never offer them mercy enter paradise o people of the elevations no fear will there be concerning you nor will you grieve
and the companions of the fire will call to the companions of paradise pour upon us some water or from whatever allah has provided you they will say indeed allah has forbidden them both to the disbelievers
who took their religion as distraction and amusement and whom the worldly life deluded so today we will forget them just as they forgot the meeting of this day of theirs and for having rejected our verses
and we had certainly brought them a book which we detailed by knowledge as guidance and mercy to a people who believe
do they await except its result the day its result comes those who had ignored it before will say the messengers of our lord had come with the truth so are there now any intercessors to intercede for us or could we be sent back to do other than we used to do they will have lost themselves and lost from them is what they used to invent
indeed your lord is allah who created the heavens and earth in six days and then established himself above the throne he covers the night with the day another night chasing it rapidly and he created the sun the moon and the stars subjected by his command unquestionably his is the creation and the command blessed is allah lord of the worlds
call upon your lord in humility and privately indeed he does not like transgressors
and cause not corruption upon the earth after its reformation and invoke him in fear and aspiration indeed the mercy of allah is near to the doers of good
and it is he who sends the winds as good tidings before his mercy until when they have carried heavy rainclouds we drive them to a dead land and we send down rain therein and bring forth thereby some of all the fruits thus will we bring forth the dead perhaps you may be reminded
and the good land its vegetation emerges by permission of its lord but that which is bad nothing emerges except sparsely with difficulty thus do we diversify the signs for a people who are grateful
we had certainly sent noah to his people and he said o my people worship allah you have no deity other than him indeed i fear for you the punishment of a tremendous day
said the eminent among his people indeed we see you in clear error
noah said o my people there is not error in me but i am a messenger from the lord of the worlds
i convey to you the messages of my lord and advise you and i know from allah what you do not know
then do you wonder that there has come to you a reminder from your lord through a man from among you that he may warn you and that you may fear allah so you might receive mercy
but they denied him so we saved him and those who were with him in the ship and we drowned those who denied our signs indeed they were a blind people
and to the aad we sent their brother hud he said o my people worship allah you have no deity other than him then will you not fear him
said the eminent ones who disbelieved among his people indeed we see you in foolishness and indeed we think you are of the liars
hud said o my people there is not foolishness in me but i am a messenger from the lord of the worlds
i convey to you the messages of my lord and i am to you a trustworthy adviser
then do you wonder that there has come to you a reminder from your lord through a man from among you that he may warn you and remember when he made you successors after the people of noah and increased you in stature extensively so remember the favors of allah that you might succeed
they said have you come to us that we should worship allah alone and leave what our fathers have worshipped then bring us what you promise us if you should be of the truthful
hud said already have defilement and anger fallen upon you from your lord do you dispute with me concerning mere names you have named them you and your fathers for which allah has not sent down any authority then wait indeed i am with you among those who wait
so we saved him and those with him by mercy from us and we eliminated those who denied our signs and they were not at all believers
and to the thamud we sent their brother salih he said o my people worship allah you have no deity other than him there has come to you clear evidence from your lord this is the she camel of allah sent to you as a sign so leave her to eat within allah s land and do not touch her with harm lest there seize you a painful punishment
and remember when he made you successors after the aad and settled you in the land and you take for yourselves palaces from its plains and carve from the mountains homes then remember the favors of allah and do not commit abuse on the earth spreading corruption
said the eminent ones who were arrogant among his people to those who were oppressed to those who believed among them do you actually know that salih is sent from his lord they said indeed we in that with which he was sent are believers
said those who were arrogant indeed we in that which you have believed are disbelievers
so they hamstrung the she camel and were insolent toward the command of their lord and said o salih bring us what you promise us if you should be of the messengers
so the earthquake seized them and they became within their home corpses fallen prone
and he turned away from them and said o my people i had certainly conveyed to you the message of my lord and advised you but you do not like advisors
and we had sent lot when he said to his people do you commit such immorality as no one has preceded you with from among the worlds
indeed you approach men with desire instead of women rather you are a transgressing people
but the answer of his people was only that they said evict them from your city indeed they are men who keep themselves pure
so we saved him and his family except for his wife she was of those who remained with the evildoers
and we rained upon them a rain of stones then see how was the end of the criminals
and to the people of madyan we sent their brother shu ayb he said o my people worship allah you have no deity other than him there has come to you clear evidence from your lord so fulfill the measure and weight and do not deprive people of their due and cause not corruption upon the earth after its reformation that is better for you if you should be believers
and do not sit on every path threatening and averting from the way of allah those who believe in him seeking to make it seem deviant and remember when you were few and he increased you and see how was the end of the corrupters
and if there should be a group among you who has believed in that with which i have been sent and a group that has not believed then be patient until allah judges between us and he is the best of judges
said the eminent ones who were arrogant among his people we will surely evict you o shu ayb and those who have believed with you from our city or you must return to our religion he said even if we were unwilling
we would have invented against allah a lie if we returned to your religion after allah had saved us from it and it is not for us to return to it except that allah our lord should will our lord has encompassed all things in knowledge upon allah we have relied our lord decide between us and our people in truth and you are the best of those who give decision
said the eminent ones who disbelieved among his people if you should follow shu ayb indeed you would then be losers
so the earthquake seized them and they became within their home corpses fallen prone
those who denied shu ayb it was as though they had never resided there those who denied shu ayb it was they who were the losers
and he turned away from them and said o my people i had certainly conveyed to you the messages of my lord and advised you so how could i grieve for a disbelieving people
and we sent to no city a prophet who was denied except that we seized its people with poverty and hardship that they might humble themselves to allah
then we exchanged in place of the bad condition good until they increased and prospered and said our fathers also were touched with hardship and ease so we seized them suddenly while they did not perceive
and if only the people of the cities had believed and feared allah we would have opened upon them blessings from the heaven and the earth but they denied the messengers so we seized them for what they were earning
then did the people of the cities feel secure from our punishment coming to them at night while they were asleep
or did the people of the cities feel secure from our punishment coming to them in the morning while they were at play
then did they feel secure from the plan of allah but no one feels secure from the plan of allah except the losing people
has it not become clear to those who inherited the earth after its previous people that if we willed we could afflict them for their sins but we seal over their hearts so they do not hear
those cities we relate to you o muhammad some of their news and certainly did their messengers come to them with clear proofs but they were not to believe in that which they had denied before thus does allah seal over the hearts of the disbelievers
and we did not find for most of them any covenant but indeed we found most of them defiantly disobedient
then we sent after them moses with our signs to pharaoh and his establishment but they were unjust toward them so see how was the end of the corrupters
and moses said o pharaoh i am a messenger from the lord of the worlds
who is obligated not to say about allah except the truth i have come to you with clear evidence from your lord so send with me the children of israel
pharaoh said if you have come with a sign then bring it forth if you should be of the truthful
so moses threw his staff and suddenly it was a serpent manifest
and he drew out his hand thereupon it was white with radiance for the observers
said the eminent among the people of pharaoh indeed this is a learned magician
who wants to expel you from your land through magic so what do you instruct
they said postpone the matter of him and his brother and send among the cities gatherers
who will bring you every learned magician
and the magicians came to pharaoh they said indeed for us is a reward if we are the predominant
he said yes and moreover you will be among those made near to me
they said o moses either you throw your staff or we will be the ones to throw first
he said throw and when they threw they bewitched the eyes of the people and struck terror into them and they presented a great feat of magic
and we inspired to moses throw your staff and at once it devoured what they were falsifying
so the truth was established and abolished was what they were doing
and pharaoh and his people were overcome right there and became debased
and the magicians fell down in prostration to allah
they said we have believed in the lord of the worlds
the lord of moses and aaron
said pharaoh you believed in him before i gave you permission indeed this is a conspiracy which you conspired in the city to expel therefrom its people but you are going to know
i will surely cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides then i will surely crucify you all
they said indeed to our lord we will return
and you do not resent us except because we believed in the signs of our lord when they came to us our lord pour upon us patience and let us die as muslims in submission to you
and the eminent among the people of pharaoh said will you leave moses and his people to cause corruption in the land and abandon you and your gods pharaoh said we will kill their sons and keep their women alive and indeed we are subjugators over them
said moses to his people seek help through allah and be patient indeed the earth belongs to allah he causes to inherit it whom he wills of his servants and the best outcome is for the righteous
they said we have been harmed before you came to us and after you have come to us he said perhaps your lord will destroy your enemy and grant you succession in the land and see how you will do
and we certainly seized the people of pharaoh with years of famine and a deficiency in fruits that perhaps they would be reminded
but when good came to them they said this is ours by right and if a bad condition struck them they saw an evil omen in moses and those with him unquestionably their fortune is with allah but most of them do not know
and they said no matter what sign you bring us with which to bewitch us we will not be believers in you
so we sent upon them the flood and locusts and lice and frogs and blood as distinct signs but they were arrogant and were a criminal people
and when the punishment descended upon them they said o moses invoke for us your lord by what he has promised you if you can remove the punishment from us we will surely believe you and we will send with you the children of israel
but when we removed the punishment from them until a term which they were to reach then at once they broke their word
so we took retribution from them and we drowned them in the sea because they denied our signs and were heedless of them
and we caused the people who had been oppressed to inherit the eastern regions of the land and the western ones which we had blessed and the good word of your lord was fulfilled for the children of israel because of what they had patiently endured and we destroyed all that pharaoh and his people were producing and what they had been building
and we took the children of israel across the sea then they came upon a people intent in devotion to some idols of theirs they said o moses make for us a god just as they have gods he said indeed you are a people behaving ignorantly
indeed those worshippers destroyed is that in which they are engaged and worthless is whatever they were doing
he said is it other than allah i should desire for you as a god while he has preferred you over the worlds
and recall o children of israel when we saved you from the people of pharaoh who were afflicting you with the worst torment killing your sons and keeping your women alive and in that was a great trial from your lord
and we made an appointment with moses for thirty nights and perfected them by the addition of ten so the term of his lord was completed as forty nights and moses said to his brother aaron take my place among my people do right by them and do not follow the way of the corrupters
and when moses arrived at our appointed time and his lord spoke to him he said my lord show me yourself that i may look at you allah said you will not see me but look at the mountain if it should remain in place then you will see me but when his lord appeared to the mountain he rendered it level and moses fell unconscious and when he awoke he said exalted are you i have repented to you and i am the first of the believers
allah said o moses i have chosen you over the people with my messages and my words to you so take what i have given you and be among the grateful
and we wrote for him on the tablets something of all things instruction and explanation for all things saying take them with determination and order your people to take the best of it i will show you the home of the defiantly disobedient
i will turn away from my signs those who are arrogant upon the earth without right and if they should see every sign they will not believe in it and if they see the way of consciousness they will not adopt it as a way but if they see the way of error they will adopt it as a way that is because they have denied our signs and they were heedless of them
those who denied our signs and the meeting of the hereafter their deeds have become worthless are they recompensed except for what they used to do
and the people of moses made after his departure from their ornaments a calf an image having a lowing sound did they not see that it could neither speak to them nor guide them to a way they took it for worship and they were wrongdoers
and when regret overcame them and they saw that they had gone astray they said if our lord does not have mercy upon us and forgive us we will surely be among the losers
and when moses returned to his people angry and grieved he said how wretched is that by which you have replaced me after my departure were you impatient over the matter of your lord and he threw down the tablets and seized his brother by the hair of his head pulling him toward him aaron said o son of my mother indeed the people oppressed me and were about to kill me so let not the enemies rejoice over me and do not place me among the wrongdoing people
moses said my lord forgive me and my brother and admit us into your mercy for you are the most merciful of the merciful
indeed those who took the calf for worship will obtain anger from their lord and humiliation in the life of this world and thus do we recompense the inventors of falsehood
but those who committed misdeeds and then repented after them and believed indeed your lord thereafter is forgiving and merciful
and when the anger subsided in moses he took up the tablets and in their inscription was guidance and mercy for those who are fearful of their lord
and moses chose from his people seventy men for our appointment and when the earthquake seized them he said my lord if you had willed you could have destroyed them before and me as well would you destroy us for what the foolish among us have done this is not but your trial by which you send astray whom you will and guide whom you will you are our protector so forgive us and have mercy upon us and you are the best of forgivers
and decree for us in this world that which is good and also in the hereafter indeed we have turned back to you allah said my punishment i afflict with it whom i will but my mercy encompasses all things so i will decree it especially for those who fear me and give zakah and those who believe in our verses
those who follow the messenger the unlettered prophet whom they find written in what they have of the torah and the gospel who enjoins upon them what is right and forbids them what is wrong and makes lawful for them the good things and prohibits for them the evil and relieves them of their burden and the shackles which were upon them so they who have believed in him honored him supported him and followed the light which was sent down with him it is those who will be the successful
say o muhammad o mankind indeed i am the messenger of allah to you all from him to whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth there is no deity except him he gives life and causes death so believe in allah and his messenger the unlettered prophet who believes in allah and his words and follow him that you may be guided
and among the people of moses is a community which guides by truth and by it establishes justice
and we divided them into twelve descendant tribes as distinct nations and we inspired to moses when his people implored him for water strike with your staff the stone and there gushed forth from it twelve springs every people knew its watering place and we shaded them with clouds and sent down upon them manna and quails saying eat from the good things with which we have provided you and they wronged us not but they were only wronging themselves
and mention o muhammad when it was said to them dwell in this city and eat from it wherever you will and say relieve us of our burdens and enter the gate bowing humbly we will then forgive you your sins we will increase the doers of good in goodness and reward
but those who wronged among them changed the words to a statement other than that which had been said to them so we sent upon them a punishment from the sky for the wrong that they were doing
and ask them about the town that was by the sea when they transgressed in the matter of the sabbath when their fish came to them openly on their sabbath day and the day they had no sabbath they did not come to them thus did we give them trial because they were defiantly disobedient
and when a community among them said why do you advise or warn a people whom allah is about to destroy or to punish with a severe punishment they the advisors said to be absolved before your lord and perhaps they may fear him
and when they forgot that by which they had been reminded we saved those who had forbidden evil and seized those who wronged with a wretched punishment because they were defiantly disobeying
so when they were insolent about that which they had been forbidden we said to them be apes despised
and mention when your lord declared that he would surely continue to send upon them until the day of resurrection those who would afflict them with the worst torment indeed your lord is swift in penalty but indeed he is forgiving and merciful
and we divided them throughout the earth into nations of them some were righteous and of them some were otherwise and we tested them with good times and bad that perhaps they would return to obedience
and there followed them successors who inherited the scripture while taking the commodities of this lower life and saying it will be forgiven for us and if an offer like it comes to them they will again take it was not the covenant of the scripture taken from them that they would not say about allah except the truth and they studied what was in it and the home of the hereafter is better for those who fear allah so will you not use reason
but those who hold fast to the book and establish prayer indeed we will not allow to be lost the reward of the reformers
and mention when we raised the mountain above them as if it was a dark cloud and they were certain that it would fall upon them and allah said take what we have given you with determination and remember what is in it that you might fear allah
and mention when your lord took from the children of adam from their loins their descendants and made them testify of themselves saying to them am i not your lord they said yes we have testified this lest you should say on the day of resurrection indeed we were of this unaware
or lest you say it was only that our fathers associated others in worship with allah before and we were but descendants after them then would you destroy us for what the falsifiers have done
and thus do we explain in detail the verses and perhaps they will return
and recite to them o muhammad the news of him to whom we gave knowledge of our signs but he detached himself from them so satan pursued him and he became of the deviators
and if we had willed we could have elevated him thereby but he adhered instead to the earth and followed his own desire so his example is like that of the dog if you chase him he pants or if you leave him he still pants that is the example of the people who denied our signs so relate the stories that perhaps they will give thought
how evil an example is that of the people who denied our signs and used to wrong themselves
whoever allah guides he is the rightly guided and whoever he sends astray it is those who are the losers
and we have certainly created for hell many of the jinn and mankind they have hearts with which they do not understand they have eyes with which they do not see and they have ears with which they do not hear those are like livestock rather they are more astray it is they who are the heedless
and to allah belong the best names so invoke him by them and leave the company of those who practice deviation concerning his names they will be recompensed for what they have been doing
and among those we created is a community which guides by truth and thereby establishes justice
but those who deny our signs we will progressively lead them to destruction from where they do not know
and i will give them time indeed my plan is firm
then do they not give thought there is in their companion muhammad no madness he is not but a clear warner
do they not look into the realm of the heavens and the earth and everything that allah has created and think that perhaps their appointed time has come near so in what statement hereafter will they believe
whoever allah sends astray there is no guide for him and he leaves them in their transgression wandering blindly
they ask you o muhammad about the hour when is its arrival say its knowledge is only with my lord none will reveal its time except him it lays heavily upon the heavens and the earth it will not come upon you except unexpectedly they ask you as if you are familiar with it say its knowledge is only with allah but most of the people do not know
say i hold not for myself the power of benefit or harm except what allah has willed and if i knew the unseen i could have acquired much wealth and no harm would have touched me i am not except a warner and a bringer of good tidings to a people who believe
it is he who created you from one soul and created from it its mate that he might dwell in security with her and when he covers her she carries a light burden and continues therein and when it becomes heavy they both invoke allah their lord if you should give us a good child we will surely be among the grateful
but when he gives them a good child they ascribe partners to him concerning that which he has given them exalted is allah above what they associate with him
do they associate with him those who create nothing and they are themselves created
and the false deities are unable to give them help nor can they help themselves
and if you believers invite them to guidance they will not follow you it is all the same for you whether you invite them or you are silent
indeed those you polytheists call upon besides allah are servants like you so call upon them and let them respond to you if you should be truthful
do they have feet by which they walk or do they have hands by which they strike or do they have eyes by which they see or do they have ears by which they hear say o muhammad call your partners and then conspire against me and give me no respite
indeed my protector is allah who has sent down the book and he is an ally to the righteous
and those you call upon besides him are unable to help you nor can they help themselves
and if you invite them to guidance they do not hear and you see them looking at you while they do not see
take what is given freely enjoin what is good and turn away from the ignorant
and if an evil suggestion comes to you from satan then seek refuge in allah indeed he is hearing and knowing
indeed those who fear allah when an impulse touches them from satan they remember him and at once they have insight
but their brothers the devils increase them in error then they do not stop short
and when you o muhammad do not bring them a sign they say why have you not contrived it say i only follow what is revealed to me from my lord this qur an is enlightenment from your lord and guidance and mercy for a people who believe
so when the qur an is recited then listen to it and pay attention that you may receive mercy
and remember your lord within yourself in humility and in fear without being apparent in speech in the mornings and the evenings and do not be among the heedless
indeed those who are near your lord are not prevented by arrogance from his worship and they exalt him and to him they prostrate
they ask you o muhammad about the bounties of war say the decision concerning bounties is for allah and the messenger so fear allah and amend that which is between you and obey allah and his messenger if you should be believers
the believers are only those who when allah is mentioned their hearts become fearful and when his verses are recited to them it increases them in faith and upon their lord they rely
the ones who establish prayer and from what we have provided them they spend
those are the believers truly for them are degrees of high position with their lord and forgiveness and noble provision
it is just as when your lord brought you out of your home for the battle of badr in truth while indeed a party among the believers were unwilling
arguing with you concerning the truth after it had become clear as if they were being driven toward death while they were looking on
remember o believers when allah promised you one of the two groups that it would be yours and you wished that the unarmed one would be yours but allah intended to establish the truth by his words and to eliminate the disbelievers
that he should establish the truth and abolish falsehood even if the criminals disliked it
remember when you asked help of your lord and he answered you indeed i will reinforce you with a thousand from the angels following one another
and allah made it not but good tidings and so that your hearts would be assured thereby and victory is not but from allah indeed allah is exalted in might and wise
remember when he overwhelmed you with drowsiness giving security from him and sent down upon you from the sky rain by which to purify you and remove from you the evil suggestions of satan and to make steadfast your hearts and plant firmly thereby your feet
remember when your lord inspired to the angels i am with you so strengthen those who have believed i will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieved so strike them upon the necks and strike from them every fingertip
that is because they opposed allah and his messenger and whoever opposes allah and his messenger indeed allah is severe in penalty
that is yours so taste it and indeed for the disbelievers is the punishment of the fire
o you who have believed when you meet those who disbelieve advancing for battle do not turn to them your backs in flight
and whoever turns his back to them on such a day unless swerving as a strategy for war or joining another company has certainly returned with anger upon him from allah and his refuge is hell and wretched is the destination
and you did not kill them but it was allah who killed them and you threw not o muhammad when you threw but it was allah who threw that he might test the believers with a good test indeed allah is hearing and knowing
that is so and also that allah will weaken the plot of the disbelievers
if you disbelievers seek the victory the defeat has come to you and if you desist from hostilities it is best for you but if you return to war we will return and never will you be availed by your large company at all even if it should increase and that is because allah is with the believers
o you who have believed obey allah and his messenger and do not turn from him while you hear his order
and do not be like those who say we have heard while they do not hear
indeed the worst of living creatures in the sight of allah are the deaf and dumb who do not use reason
had allah known any good in them he would have made them hear and if he had made them hear they would still have turned away while they were refusing
o you who have believed respond to allah and to the messenger when he calls you to that which gives you life and know that allah intervenes between a man and his heart and that to him you will be gathered
and fear a trial which will not strike those who have wronged among you exclusively and know that allah is severe in penalty
and remember when you were few and oppressed in the land fearing that people might abduct you but he sheltered you supported you with his victory and provided you with good things that you might be grateful
o you who have believed do not betray allah and the messenger or betray your trusts while you know the consequence
and know that your properties and your children are but a trial and that allah has with him a great reward
o you who have believed if you fear allah he will grant you a criterion and will remove from you your misdeeds and forgive you and allah is the possessor of great bounty
and remember o muhammad when those who disbelieved plotted against you to restrain you or kill you or evict you from makkah but they plan and allah plans and allah is the best of planners
and when our verses are recited to them they say we have heard if we willed we could say something like this this is not but legends of the former peoples
and remember when they said o allah if this should be the truth from you then rain down upon us stones from the sky or bring us a painful punishment
but allah would not punish them while you o muhammad are among them and allah would not punish them while they seek forgiveness
but why should allah not punish them while they obstruct people from al masjid al haram and they were not fit to be its guardians its true guardians are not but the righteous but most of them do not know
and their prayer at the house was not except whistling and handclapping so taste the punishment for what you disbelieved
indeed those who disbelieve spend their wealth to avert people from the way of allah so they will spend it then it will be for them a source of regret then they will be overcome and those who have disbelieved unto hell they will be gathered
this is so that allah may distinguish the wicked from the good and place the wicked some of them upon others and heap them all together and put them into hell it is those who are the losers
say to those who have disbelieved that if they cease what has previously occurred will be forgiven for them but if they return to hostility then the precedent of the former rebellious peoples has already taken place
and fight them until there is no fitnah and until the religion all of it is for allah and if they cease then indeed allah is seeing of what they do
but if they turn away then know that allah is your protector excellent is the protector and excellent is the helper
and know that anything you obtain of war booty then indeed for allah is one fifth of it and for the messenger and for his near relatives and the orphans the needy and the stranded traveler if you have believed in allah and in that which we sent down to our servant on the day of criterion the day when the two armies met and allah over all things is competent
remember when you were on the near side of the valley and they were on the farther side and the caravan was lower in position than you if you had made an appointment to meet you would have missed the appointment but it was so that allah might accomplish a matter already destined that those who perished through disbelief would perish upon evidence and those who lived in faith would live upon evidence and indeed allah is hearing and knowing
remember o muhammad when allah showed them to you in your dream as few and if he had shown them to you as many you believers would have lost courage and would have disputed in the matter of whether to fight but allah saved you from that indeed he is knowing of that within the breasts
and remember when he showed them to you when you met as few in your eyes and he made you appear as few in their eyes so that allah might accomplish a matter already destined and to allah are all matters returned
o you who have believed when you encounter a company from the enemy forces stand firm and remember allah much that you may be successful
and obey allah and his messenger and do not dispute and thus lose courage and then your strength would depart and be patient indeed allah is with the patient
and do not be like those who came forth from their homes insolently and to be seen by people and avert them from the way of allah and allah is encompassing of what they do
and remember when satan made their deeds pleasing to them and said no one can overcome you today from among the people and indeed i am your protector but when the two armies sighted each other he turned on his heels and said indeed i am disassociated from you indeed i see what you do not see indeed i fear allah and allah is severe in penalty
remember when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts was disease said their religion has deluded those muslims but whoever relies upon allah then indeed allah is exalted in might and wise
and if you could but see when the angels take the souls of those who disbelieved they are striking their faces and their backs and saying taste the punishment of the burning fire
that is for what your hands have put forth of evil and because allah is not ever unjust to his servants
theirs is like the custom of the people of pharaoh and of those before them they disbelieved in the signs of allah so allah seized them for their sins indeed allah is powerful and severe in penalty
that is because allah would not change a favor which he had bestowed upon a people until they change what is within themselves and indeed allah is hearing and knowing
theirs is like the custom of the people of pharaoh and of those before them they denied the signs of their lord so we destroyed them for their sins and we drowned the people of pharaoh and all of them were wrongdoers
indeed the worst of living creatures in the sight of allah are those who have disbelieved and they will not ever believe
the ones with whom you made a treaty but then they break their pledge every time and they do not fear allah
so if you o muhammad gain dominance over them in war disperse by means of them those behind them that perhaps they will be reminded
if you have reason to fear from a people betrayal throw their treaty back to them putting you on equal terms indeed allah does not like traitors
and let not those who disbelieve think they will escape indeed they will not cause failure to allah
and prepare against them whatever you are able of power and of steeds of war by which you may terrify the enemy of allah and your enemy and others besides them whom you do not know but whom allah knows and whatever you spend in the cause of allah will be fully repaid to you and you will not be wronged
and if they incline to peace then incline to it also and rely upon allah indeed it is he who is the hearing the knowing
but if they intend to deceive you then sufficient for you is allah it is he who supported you with his help and with the believers
and brought together their hearts if you had spent all that is in the earth you could not have brought their hearts together but allah brought them together indeed he is exalted in might and wise
o prophet sufficient for you is allah and for whoever follows you of the believers
o prophet urge the believers to battle if there are among you twenty who are steadfast they will overcome two hundred and if there are among you one hundred who are steadfast they will overcome a thousand of those who have disbelieved because they are a people who do not understand
now allah has lightened the hardship for you and he knows that among you is weakness so if there are from you one hundred who are steadfast they will overcome two hundred and if there are among you a thousand they will overcome two thousand by permission of allah and allah is with the steadfast
it is not for a prophet to have captives of war until he inflicts a massacre upon allah s enemies in the land some muslims desire the commodities of this world but allah desires for you the hereafter and allah is exalted in might and wise
if not for a decree from allah that preceded you would have been touched for what you took by a great punishment
so consume what you have taken of war booty as being lawful and good and fear allah indeed allah is forgiving and merciful
o prophet say to whoever is in your hands of the captives if allah knows any good in your hearts he will give you something better than what was taken from you and he will forgive you and allah is forgiving and merciful
but if they intend to betray you then they have already betrayed allah before and he empowered you over them and allah is knowing and wise
indeed those who have believed and emigrated and fought with their wealth and lives in the cause of allah and those who gave shelter and aided they are allies of one another but those who believed and did not emigrate for you there is no guardianship of them until they emigrate and if they seek help of you for the religion then you must help except against a people between yourselves and whom is a treaty and allah is seeing of what you do
and those who disbelieved are allies of one another if you do not do so there will be fitnah on earth and great corruption
but those who have believed and emigrated and fought in the cause of allah and those who gave shelter and aided it is they who are the believers truly for them is forgiveness and noble provision
and those who believed after the initial emigration and emigrated and fought with you they are of you but those of blood relationship are more entitled to inheritance in the decree of allah indeed allah is knowing of all things
this is a declaration of disassociation from allah and his messenger to those with whom you had made a treaty among the polytheists
so travel freely o disbelievers throughout the land during four months but know that you cannot cause failure to allah and that allah will disgrace the disbelievers
and it is an announcement from allah and his messenger to the people on the day of the greater pilgrimage that allah is disassociated from the disbelievers and so is his messenger so if you repent that is best for you but if you turn away then know that you will not cause failure to allah and give tidings to those who disbelieve of a painful punishment
excepted are those with whom you made a treaty among the polytheists and then they have not been deficient toward you in anything or supported anyone against you so complete for them their treaty until their term has ended indeed allah loves the righteous who fear him
and when the sacred months have passed then kill the polytheists wherever you find them and capture them and besiege them and sit in wait for them at every place of ambush but if they should repent establish prayer and give zakah let them go on their way indeed allah is forgiving and merciful
and if any one of the polytheists seeks your protection then grant him protection so that he may hear the words of allah then deliver him to his place of safety that is because they are a people who do not know
how can there be for the polytheists a treaty in the sight of allah and with his messenger except for those with whom you made a treaty at al masjid al haram so as long as they are upright toward you be upright toward them indeed allah loves the righteous who fear him
how can there be a treaty while if they gain dominance over you they do not observe concerning you any pact of kinship or covenant of protection they satisfy you with their mouths but their hearts refuse compliance and most of them are defiantly disobedient
they have exchanged the signs of allah for a small price and averted people from his way indeed it was evil that they were doing
they do not observe toward a believer any pact of kinship or covenant of protection and it is they who are the transgressors
but if they repent establish prayer and give zakah then they are your brothers in religion and we detail the verses for a people who know
and if they break their oaths after their treaty and defame your religion then fight the leaders of disbelief for indeed there are no oaths sacred to them fight them that they might cease
would you not fight a people who broke their oaths and determined to expel the messenger and they had begun the attack upon you the first time do you fear them but allah has more right that you should fear him if you are truly believers
fight them allah will punish them by your hands and will disgrace them and give you victory over them and satisfy the breasts of a believing people
and remove the fury in the believers hearts and allah turns in forgiveness to whom he wills and allah is knowing and wise
do you think that you will be left as you are while allah has not yet made evident those among you who strive for his cause and do not take other than allah his messenger and the believers as intimates and allah is acquainted with what you do
it is not for the polytheists to maintain the mosques of allah while witnessing against themselves with disbelief for those their deeds have become worthless and in the fire they will abide eternally
the mosques of allah are only to be maintained by those who believe in allah and the last day and establish prayer and give zakah and do not fear except allah for it is expected that those will be of the rightly guided
have you made the providing of water for the pilgrim and the maintenance of al masjid al haram equal to the deeds of one who believes in allah and the last day and strives in the cause of allah they are not equal in the sight of allah and allah does not guide the wrongdoing people
the ones who have believed emigrated and striven in the cause of allah with their wealth and their lives are greater in rank in the sight of allah and it is those who are the attainers of success
their lord gives them good tidings of mercy from him and approval and of gardens for them wherein is enduring pleasure
they will be abiding therein forever indeed allah has with him a great reward
o you who have believed do not take your fathers or your brothers as allies if they have preferred disbelief over belief and whoever does so among you then it is those who are the wrongdoers
say o muhammad if your fathers your sons your brothers your wives your relatives wealth which you have obtained commerce wherein you fear decline and dwellings with which you are pleased are more beloved to you than allah and his messenger and jihad in his cause then wait until allah executes his command and allah does not guide the defiantly disobedient people
allah has already given you victory in many regions and even on the day of hunayn when your great number pleased you but it did not avail you at all and the earth was confining for you with its vastness then you turned back fleeing
then allah sent down his tranquillity upon his messenger and upon the believers and sent down soldiers angels whom you did not see and punished those who disbelieved and that is the recompense of the disbelievers
then allah will accept repentance after that for whom he wills and allah is forgiving and merciful
o you who have believed indeed the polytheists are unclean so let them not approach al masjid al haram after this their final year and if you fear privation allah will enrich you from his bounty if he wills indeed allah is knowing and wise
fight those who do not believe in allah or in the last day and who do not consider unlawful what allah and his messenger have made unlawful and who do not adopt the religion of truth from those who were given the scripture fight until they give the jizyah willingly while they are humbled
the jews say ezra is the son of allah and the christians say the messiah is the son of allah that is their statement from their mouths they imitate the saying of those who disbelieved before them may allah destroy them how are they deluded
they have taken their scholars and monks as lords besides allah and also the messiah the son of mary and they were not commanded except to worship one god there is no deity except him exalted is he above whatever they associate with him
they want to extinguish the light of allah with their mouths but allah refuses except to perfect his light although the disbelievers dislike it
it is he who has sent his messenger with guidance and the religion of truth to manifest it over all religion although they who associate others with allah dislike it
o you who have believed indeed many of the scholars and the monks devour the wealth of people unjustly and avert them from the way of allah and those who hoard gold and silver and spend it not in the way of allah give them tidings of a painful punishment
the day when it will be heated in the fire of hell and seared therewith will be their foreheads their flanks and their backs it will be said this is what you hoarded for yourselves so taste what you used to hoard
indeed the number of months with allah is twelve lunar months in the register of allah from the day he created the heavens and the earth of these four are sacred that is the correct religion so do not wrong yourselves during them and fight against the disbelievers collectively as they fight against you collectively and know that allah is with the righteous who fear him
indeed the postponing of restriction within sacred months is an increase in disbelief by which those who have disbelieved are led further astray they make it lawful one year and unlawful another year to correspond to the number made unlawful by allah and thus make lawful what allah has made unlawful made pleasing to them is the evil of their deeds and allah does not guide the disbelieving people
o you who have believed what is the matter with you that when you are told to go forth in the cause of allah you adhere heavily to the earth are you satisfied with the life of this world rather than the hereafter but what is the enjoyment of worldly life compared to the hereafter except a very little
if you do not go forth he will punish you with a painful punishment and will replace you with another people and you will not harm him at all and allah is over all things competent
if you do not aid the prophet allah has already aided him when those who disbelieved had driven him out of makkah as one of two when they were in the cave and he said to his companion do not grieve indeed allah is with us and allah sent down his tranquillity upon him and supported him with angels you did not see and made the word of those who disbelieved the lowest while the word of allah that is the highest and allah is exalted in might and wise
go forth whether light or heavy and strive with your wealth and your lives in the cause of allah that is better for you if you only knew
had it been an easy gain and a moderate trip the hypocrites would have followed you but distant to them was the journey and they will swear by allah if we were able we would have gone forth with you destroying themselves through false oaths and allah knows that indeed they are liars
may allah pardon you o muhammad why did you give them permission to remain behind you should not have until it was evident to you who were truthful and you knew who were the liars
those who believe in allah and the last day would not ask permission of you to be excused from striving with their wealth and their lives and allah is knowing of those who fear him
only those would ask permission of you who do not believe in allah and the last day and whose hearts have doubted and they in their doubt are hesitating
and if they had intended to go forth they would have prepared for it some preparation but allah disliked their being sent so he kept them back and they were told remain behind with those who remain
had they gone forth with you they would not have increased you except in confusion and they would have been active among you seeking to cause you fitnah and among you are avid listeners to them and allah is knowing of the wrongdoers
they had already desired dissension before and had upset matters for you until the truth came and the ordinance of allah appeared while they were averse
and among them is he who says permit me to remain at home and do not put me to trial unquestionably into trial they have fallen and indeed hell will encompass the disbelievers
if good befalls you it distresses them but if disaster strikes you they say we took our matter in hand before and turn away while they are rejoicing
say never will we be struck except by what allah has decreed for us he is our protector and upon allah let the believers rely
say do you await for us except one of the two best things while we await for you that allah will afflict you with punishment from himself or at our hands so wait indeed we along with you are waiting
say spend willingly or unwillingly never will it be accepted from you indeed you have been a defiantly disobedient people
and what prevents their expenditures from being accepted from them but that they have disbelieved in allah and in his messenger and that they come not to prayer except while they are lazy and that they do not spend except while they are unwilling
so let not their wealth or their children impress you allah only intends to punish them through them in worldly life and that their souls should depart at death while they are disbelievers
and they swear by allah that they are from among you while they are not from among you but they are a people who are afraid
if they could find a refuge or some caves or any place to enter and hide they would turn to it while they run heedlessly
and among them are some who criticize you concerning the distribution of charities if they are given from them they approve but if they are not given from them at once they become angry
if only they had been satisfied with what allah and his messenger gave them and said sufficient for us is allah allah will give us of his bounty and so will his messenger indeed we are desirous toward allah it would have been better for them
zakah expenditures are only for the poor and for the needy and for those employed to collect zakah and for bringing hearts together for islam and for freeing captives or slaves and for those in debt and for the cause of allah and for the stranded traveler an obligation imposed by allah and allah is knowing and wise
and among them are those who abuse the prophet and say he is an ear say it is an ear of goodness for you that believes in allah and believes the believers and is a mercy to those who believe among you and those who abuse the messenger of allah for them is a painful punishment
they swear by allah to you muslims to satisfy you but allah and his messenger are more worthy for them to satisfy if they should be believers
do they not know that whoever opposes allah and his messenger that for him is the fire of hell wherein he will abide eternally that is the great disgrace
they hypocrites are apprehensive lest a surah be revealed about them informing them of what is in their hearts say mock as you wish indeed allah will expose that which you fear
and if you ask them they will surely say we were only conversing and playing say is it allah and his verses and his messenger that you were mocking
make no excuse you have disbelieved after your belief if we pardon one faction of you we will punish another faction because they were criminals
the hypocrite men and hypocrite women are of one another they enjoin what is wrong and forbid what is right and close their hands they have forgotten allah so he has forgotten them accordingly indeed the hypocrites it is they who are the defiantly disobedient
allah has promised the hypocrite men and hypocrite women and the disbelievers the fire of hell wherein they will abide eternally it is sufficient for them and allah has cursed them and for them is an enduring punishment
you disbelievers are like those before you they were stronger than you in power and more abundant in wealth and children they enjoyed their portion of worldly enjoyment and you have enjoyed your portion as those before you enjoyed their portion and you have engaged in vanities like that in which they engaged it is those whose deeds have become worthless in this world and in the hereafter and it is they who are the losers
has there not reached them the news of those before them the people of noah and the tribes of aad and thamud and the people of abraham and the companions of madyan and the towns overturned their messengers came to them with clear proofs and allah would never have wronged them but they were wronging themselves
the believing men and believing women are allies of one another they enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and establish prayer and give zakah and obey allah and his messenger those allah will have mercy upon them indeed allah is exalted in might and wise
allah has promised the believing men and believing women gardens beneath which rivers flow wherein they abide eternally and pleasant dwellings in gardens of perpetual residence but approval from allah is greater it is that which is the great attainment
o prophet fight against the disbelievers and the hypocrites and be harsh upon them and their refuge is hell and wretched is the destination
they swear by allah that they did not say anything against the prophet while they had said the word of disbelief and disbelieved after their pretense of islam and planned that which they were not to attain and they were not resentful except for the fact that allah and his messenger had enriched them of his bounty so if they repent it is better for them but if they turn away allah will punish them with a painful punishment in this world and the hereafter and there will not be for them on earth any protector or helper
and among them are those who made a covenant with allah saying if he should give us from his bounty we will surely spend in charity and we will surely be among the righteous
but when he gave them from his bounty they were stingy with it and turned away while they refused
so he penalized them with hypocrisy in their hearts until the day they will meet him because they failed allah in what they promised him and because they habitually used to lie
did they not know that allah knows their secrets and their private conversations and that allah is the knower of the unseen
those who criticize the contributors among the believers concerning their charities and criticize the ones who find nothing to spend except their effort so they ridicule them allah will ridicule them and they will have a painful punishment
ask forgiveness for them o muhammad or do not ask forgiveness for them if you should ask forgiveness for them seventy times never will allah forgive them that is because they disbelieved in allah and his messenger and allah does not guide the defiantly disobedient people
those who remained behind rejoiced in their staying at home after the departure of the messenger of allah and disliked to strive with their wealth and their lives in the cause of allah and said do not go forth in the heat say the fire of hell is more intensive in heat if they would but understand
so let them laugh a little and then weep much as recompense for what they used to earn
if allah should return you to a faction of them after the expedition and then they ask your permission to go out to battle say you will not go out with me ever and you will never fight with me an enemy indeed you were satisfied with sitting at home the first time so sit now with those who stay behind
and do not pray the funeral prayer o muhammad over any of them who has died ever or stand at his grave indeed they disbelieved in allah and his messenger and died while they were defiantly disobedient
and let not their wealth and their children impress you allah only intends to punish them through them in this world and that their souls should depart at death while they are disbelievers
and when a surah was revealed enjoining them to believe in allah and to fight with his messenger those of wealth among them asked your permission to stay back and said leave us to be with them who sit at home
they were satisfied to be with those who stay behind and their hearts were sealed over so they do not understand
but the messenger and those who believed with him fought with their wealth and their lives those will have all that is good and it is those who are the successful
allah has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide eternally that is the great attainment
and those with excuses among the bedouins came to be permitted to remain and they who had lied to allah and his messenger sat at home there will strike those who disbelieved among them a painful punishment
there is not upon the weak or upon the ill or upon those who do not find anything to spend any discomfort when they are sincere to allah and his messenger there is not upon the doers of good any cause for blame and allah is forgiving and merciful
nor is there blame upon those who when they came to you that you might give them mounts you said i can find nothing for you to ride upon they turned back while their eyes overflowed with tears out of grief that they could not find something to spend for the cause of allah
the cause for blame is only upon those who ask permission of you while they are rich they are satisfied to be with those who stay behind and allah has sealed over their hearts so they do not know
they will make excuses to you when you have returned to them say make no excuse never will we believe you allah has already informed us of your news and allah will observe your deeds and so will his messenger then you will be taken back to the knower of the unseen and the witnessed and he will inform you of what you used to do
they will swear by allah to you when you return to them that you would leave them alone so leave them alone indeed they are evil and their refuge is hell as recompense for what they had been earning
they swear to you so that you might be satisfied with them but if you should be satisfied with them indeed allah is not satisfied with a defiantly disobedient people
the bedouins are stronger in disbelief and hypocrisy and more likely not to know the limits of what laws allah has revealed to his messenger and allah is knowing and wise
and among the bedouins are some who consider what they spend as a loss and await for you turns of misfortune upon them will be a misfortune of evil and allah is hearing and knowing
but among the bedouins are some who believe in allah and the last day and consider what they spend as means of nearness to allah and of obtaining invocations of the messenger unquestionably it is a means of nearness for them allah will admit them to his mercy indeed allah is forgiving and merciful
and the first forerunners in the faith among the muhajireen and the ansar and those who followed them with good conduct allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with him and he has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide forever that is the great attainment
and among those around you of the bedouins are hypocrites and also from the people of madinah they have become accustomed to hypocrisy you o muhammad do not know them but we know them we will punish them twice in this world then they will be returned to a great punishment
and there are others who have acknowledged their sins they had mixed a righteous deed with another that was bad perhaps allah will turn to them in forgiveness indeed allah is forgiving and merciful
take o muhammad from their wealth a charity by which you purify them and cause them increase and invoke allah s blessings upon them indeed your invocations are reassurance for them and allah is hearing and knowing
do they not know that it is allah who accepts repentance from his servants and receives charities and that it is allah who is the accepting of repentance the merciful
and say do as you will for allah will see your deeds and so will his messenger and the believers and you will be returned to the knower of the unseen and the witnessed and he will inform you of what you used to do
and there are others deferred until the command of allah whether he will punish them or whether he will forgive them and allah is knowing and wise
and there are those hypocrites who took for themselves a mosque for causing harm and disbelief and division among the believers and as a station for whoever had warred against allah and his messenger before and they will surely swear we intended only the best and allah testifies that indeed they are liars
do not stand for prayer within it ever a mosque founded on righteousness from the first day is more worthy for you to stand in within it are men who love to purify themselves and allah loves those who purify themselves
then is one who laid the foundation of his building on righteousness with fear from allah and seeking his approval better or one who laid the foundation of his building on the edge of a bank about to collapse so it collapsed with him into the fire of hell and allah does not guide the wrongdoing people
their building which they built will not cease to be a cause of skepticism in their hearts until their hearts are stopped and allah is knowing and wise
indeed allah has purchased from the believers their lives and their properties in exchange for that they will have paradise they fight in the cause of allah so they kill and are killed it is a true promise binding upon him in the torah and the gospel and the qur an and who is truer to his covenant than allah so rejoice in your transaction which you have contracted and it is that which is the great attainment
such believers are the repentant the worshippers the praisers of allah the travelers for his cause those who bow and prostrate in prayer those who enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and those who observe the limits set by allah and give good tidings to the believers
it is not for the prophet and those who have believed to ask forgiveness for the polytheists even if they were relatives after it has become clear to them that they are companions of hellfire
and the request of forgiveness of abraham for his father was only because of a promise he had made to him but when it became apparent to abraham that his father was an enemy to allah he disassociated himself from him indeed was abraham compassionate and patient
and allah would not let a people stray after he has guided them until he makes clear to them what they should avoid indeed allah is knowing of all things
indeed to allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth he gives life and causes death and you have not besides allah any protector or any helper
allah has already forgiven the prophet and the muhajireen and the ansar who followed him in the hour of difficulty after the hearts of a party of them had almost inclined to doubt and then he forgave them indeed he was to them kind and merciful
and he also forgave the three who were left behind and regretted their error to the point that the earth closed in on them in spite of its vastness and their souls confined them and they were certain that there is no refuge from allah except in him then he turned to them so they could repent indeed allah is the accepting of repentance the merciful
o you who have believed fear allah and be with those who are true
it was not proper for the people of madinah and those surrounding them of the bedouins that they remain behind after the departure of the messenger of allah or that they prefer themselves over his self that is because they are not afflicted by thirst or fatigue or hunger in the cause of allah nor do they tread on any ground that enrages the disbelievers nor do they inflict upon an enemy any infliction but that is registered for them as a righteous deed indeed allah does not allow to be lost the reward of the doers of good
nor do they spend an expenditure small or large or cross a valley but that it is registered for them that allah may reward them for the best of what they were doing
and it is not for the believers to go forth to battle all at once for there should separate from every division of them a group remaining to obtain understanding in the religion and warn their people when they return to them that they might be cautious
o you who have believed fight those adjacent to you of the disbelievers and let them find in you harshness and know that allah is with the righteous
and whenever a surah is revealed there are among the hypocrites those who say which of you has this increased faith as for those who believed it has increased them in faith while they are rejoicing
but as for those in whose hearts is disease it has only increased them in evil in addition to their evil and they will have died while they are disbelievers
do they not see that they are tried every year once or twice but then they do not repent nor do they remember
and whenever a surah is revealed they look at each other saying does anyone see you and then they dismiss themselves allah has dismissed their hearts because they are a people who do not understand
there has certainly come to you a messenger from among yourselves grievous to him is what you suffer he is concerned over you and to the believers is kind and merciful
but if they turn away o muhammad say sufficient for me is allah there is no deity except him on him i have relied and he is the lord of the great throne
alif lam ra these are the verses of the wise book
have the people been amazed that we revealed revelation to a man from among them saying warn mankind and give good tidings to those who believe that they will have a firm precedence of honor with their lord but the disbelievers say indeed this is an obvious magician
indeed your lord is allah who created the heavens and the earth in six days and then established himself above the throne arranging the matter of his creation there is no intercessor except after his permission that is allah your lord so worship him then will you not remember
to him is your return all together it is the promise of allah which is truth indeed he begins the process of creation and then repeats it that he may reward those who have believed and done righteous deeds in justice but those who disbelieved will have a drink of scalding water and a painful punishment for what they used to deny
it is he who made the sun a shining light and the moon a derived light and determined for it phases that you may know the number of years and account of time allah has not created this except in truth he details the signs for a people who know
indeed in the alternation of the night and the day and in what allah has created in the heavens and the earth are signs for a people who fear allah
indeed those who do not expect the meeting with us and are satisfied with the life of this world and feel secure therein and those who are heedless of our signs
for those their refuge will be the fire because of what they used to earn
indeed those who have believed and done righteous deeds their lord will guide them because of their faith beneath them rivers will flow in the gardens of pleasure
their call therein will be exalted are you o allah and their greeting therein will be peace and the last of their call will be praise to allah lord of the worlds
and if allah was to hasten for the people the evil they invoke as he hastens for them the good their term would have been ended for them but we leave the ones who do not expect the meeting with us in their transgression wandering blindly
and when affliction touches man he calls upon us whether lying on his side or sitting or standing but when we remove from him his affliction he continues in disobedience as if he had never called upon us to remove an affliction that touched him thus is made pleasing to the transgressors that which they have been doing
and we had already destroyed generations before you when they wronged and their messengers had come to them with clear proofs but they were not to believe thus do we recompense the criminal people
then we made you successors in the land after them so that we may observe how you will do
and when our verses are recited to them as clear evidences those who do not expect the meeting with us say bring us a qur an other than this or change it say o muhammad it is not for me to change it on my own accord i only follow what is revealed to me indeed i fear if i should disobey my lord the punishment of a tremendous day
say if allah had willed i would not have recited it to you nor would he have made it known to you for i had remained among you a lifetime before it then will you not reason
so who is more unjust than he who invents a lie about allah or denies his signs indeed the criminals will not succeed
and they worship other than allah that which neither harms them nor benefits them and they say these are our intercessors with allah say do you inform allah of something he does not know in the heavens or on the earth exalted is he and high above what they associate with him
and mankind was not but one community united in religion but then they differed and if not for a word that preceded from your lord it would have been judged between them immediately concerning that over which they differ
and they say why is a sign not sent down to him from his lord so say the unseen is only for allah to administer so wait indeed i am with you among those who wait
and when we give the people a taste of mercy after adversity has touched them at once they conspire against our verses say allah is swifter in strategy indeed our messengers record that which you conspire
it is he who enables you to travel on land and sea until when you are in ships and they sail with them by a good wind and they rejoice therein there comes a storm wind and the waves come upon them from everywhere and they assume that they are surrounded supplicating allah sincere to him in religion if you should save us from this we will surely be among the thankful
but when he saves them at once they commit injustice upon the earth without right o mankind your injustice is only against yourselves being merely the enjoyment of worldly life then to us is your return and we will inform you of what you used to do
the example of this worldly life is but like rain which we have sent down from the sky that the plants of the earth absorb those from which men and livestock eat until when the earth has taken on its adornment and is beautified and its people suppose that they have capability over it there comes to it our command by night or by day and we make it as a harvest as if it had not flourished yesterday thus do we explain in detail the signs for a people who give thought
and allah invites to the home of peace and guides whom he wills to a straight path
for them who have done good is the best reward and extra no darkness will cover their faces nor humiliation those are companions of paradise they will abide therein eternally
but they who have earned blame for evil doings the recompense of an evil deed is its equivalent and humiliation will cover them they will have from allah no protector it will be as if their faces are covered with pieces of the night so dark are they those are the companions of the fire they will abide therein eternally
and mention o muhammad the day we will gather them all together then we will say to those who associated others with allah remain in your place you and your partners then we will separate them and their partners will say you did not used to worship us
and sufficient is allah as a witness between us and you that we were of your worship unaware
there on that day every soul will be put to trial for what it did previously and they will be returned to allah their master the truth and lost from them is whatever they used to invent
say who provides for you from the heaven and the earth or who controls hearing and sight and who brings the living out of the dead and brings the dead out of the living and who arranges every matter they will say allah so say then will you not fear him
for that is allah your lord the truth and what can be beyond truth except error so how are you averted
thus the word of your lord has come into effect upon those who defiantly disobeyed that they will not believe
say are there of your partners any who begins creation and then repeats it say allah begins creation and then repeats it so how are you deluded
say are there of your partners any who guides to the truth say allah guides to the truth so is he who guides to the truth more worthy to be followed or he who guides not unless he is guided then what is wrong with you how do you judge
and most of them follow not except assumption indeed assumption avails not against the truth at all indeed allah is knowing of what they do
and it was not possible for this qur an to be produced by other than allah but it is a confirmation of what was before it and a detailed explanation of the former scripture about which there is no doubt from the lord of the worlds
or do they say about the prophet he invented it say then bring forth a surah like it and call upon for assistance whomever you can besides allah if you should be truthful
rather they have denied that which they encompass not in knowledge and whose interpretation has not yet come to them thus did those before them deny then observe how was the end of the wrongdoers
and of them are those who believe in it and of them are those who do not believe in it and your lord is most knowing of the corrupters
and if they deny you o muhammad then say for me are my deeds and for you are your deeds you are disassociated from what i do and i am disassociated from what you do
and among them are those who listen to you but can you cause the deaf to hear although they will not use reason
and among them are those who look at you but can you guide the blind although they will not attempt to see
indeed allah does not wrong the people at all but it is the people who are wronging themselves
and on the day when he will gather them it will be as if they had not remained in the world but an hour of the day and they will know each other those will have lost who denied the meeting with allah and were not guided
and whether we show you some of what we promise them o muhammad or we take you in death to us is their return then either way allah is a witness concerning what they are doing
and for every nation is a messenger so when their messenger comes it will be judged between them in justice and they will not be wronged
and they say when is the fulfillment of this promise if you should be truthful
say i possess not for myself any harm or benefit except what allah should will for every nation is a specified term when their time has come then they will not remain behind an hour nor will they precede it
say have you considered if his punishment should come to you by night or by day for which aspect of it would the criminals be impatient
then is it that when it has actually occurred you will believe in it now and you were once for it impatient
then it will be said to those who had wronged taste the punishment of eternity are you being recompensed except for what you used to earn
and they ask information of you o muhammad is it true say yes by my lord indeed it is truth and you will not cause failure to allah
and if each soul that wronged had everything on earth it would offer it in ransom and they will confide regret when they see the punishment and they will be judged in justice and they will not be wronged
unquestionably to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth unquestionably the promise of allah is truth but most of them do not know
he gives life and causes death and to him you will be returned
o mankind there has to come to you instruction from your lord and healing for what is in the breasts and guidance and mercy for the believers
say in the bounty of allah and in his mercy in that let them rejoice it is better than what they accumulate
say have you seen what allah has sent down to you of provision of which you have made some lawful and some unlawful say has allah permitted you to do so or do you invent something about allah
and what will be the supposition of those who invent falsehood about allah on the day of resurrection indeed allah is full of bounty to the people but most of them are not grateful
and o muhammad you are not engaged in any matter or recite any of the qur an and you people do not do any deed except that we are witness over you when you are involved in it and not absent from your lord is any part of an atom s weight within the earth or within the heaven or anything smaller than that or greater but that it is in a clear register
unquestionably for the allies of allah there will be no fear concerning them nor will they grieve
those who believed and were fearing allah
for them are good tidings in the worldly life and in the hereafter no change is there in the words of allah that is what is the great attainment
and let not their speech grieve you indeed honor due to power belongs to allah entirely he is the hearing the knowing
unquestionably to allah belongs whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth and those who invoke other than allah do not actually follow his partners they follow not except assumption and they are not but falsifying
it is he who made for you the night to rest therein and the day giving sight indeed in that are signs for a people who listen
they have said allah has taken a son exalted is he he is the one free of need to him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth you have no authority for this claim do you say about allah that which you do not know
say indeed those who invent falsehood about allah will not succeed
for them is brief enjoyment in this world then to us is their return then we will make them taste the severe punishment because they used to disbelieve
and recite to them the news of noah when he said to his people o my people if my residence and my reminding of the signs of allah has become burdensome upon you then i have relied upon allah so resolve upon your plan and call upon your associates then let not your plan be obscure to you then carry it out upon me and do not give me respite
and if you turn away from my advice then no payment have i asked of you my reward is only from allah and i have been commanded to be of the muslims
and they denied him so we saved him and those with him in the ship and made them successors and we drowned those who denied our signs then see how was the end of those who were warned
then we sent after him messengers to their peoples and they came to them with clear proofs but they were not to believe in that which they had denied before thus we seal over the hearts of the transgressors
then we sent after them moses and aaron to pharaoh and his establishment with our signs but they behaved arrogantly and were a criminal people
so when there came to them the truth from us they said indeed this is obvious magic
moses said do you say thus about the truth when it has come to you is this magic but magicians will not succeed
they said have you come to us to turn us away from that upon which we found our fathers and so that you two may have grandeur in the land and we are not believers in you
and pharaoh said bring to me every learned magician
so when the magicians came moses said to them throw down whatever you will throw
and when they had thrown moses said what you have brought is only magic indeed allah will expose its worthlessness indeed allah does not amend the work of corrupters
and allah will establish the truth by his words even if the criminals dislike it
but no one believed moses except some youths among his people for fear of pharaoh and his establishment that they would persecute them and indeed pharaoh was haughty within the land and indeed he was of the transgressors
and moses said o my people if you have believed in allah then rely upon him if you should be muslims
so they said upon allah do we rely our lord make us not objects of trial for the wrongdoing people
and save us by your mercy from the disbelieving people
and we inspired to moses and his brother settle your people in egypt in houses and make your houses facing the qiblah and establish prayer and give good tidings to the believers
and moses said our lord indeed you have given pharaoh and his establishment splendor and wealth in the worldly life our lord that they may lead men astray from your way our lord obliterate their wealth and harden their hearts so that they will not believe until they see the painful punishment
allah said your supplication has been answered so remain on a right course and follow not the way of those who do not know
and we took the children of israel across the sea and pharaoh and his soldiers pursued them in tyranny and enmity until when drowning overtook him he said i believe that there is no deity except that in whom the children of israel believe and i am of the muslims
now and you had disobeyed him before and were of the corrupters
so today we will save you in body that you may be to those who succeed you a sign and indeed many among the people of our signs are heedless
and we had certainty settled the children of israel in an agreeable settlement and provided them with good things and they did not differ until after knowledge had come to them indeed your lord will judge between them on the day of resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ
so if you are in doubt o muhammad about that which we have revealed to you then ask those who have been reading the scripture before you the truth has certainly come to you from your lord so never be among the doubters
and never be of those who deny the signs of allah and thus be among the losers
indeed those upon whom the word of your lord has come into effect will not believe
even if every sign should come to them until they see the painful punishment
then has there not been a single city that believed so its faith benefited it except the people of jonah when they believed we removed from them the punishment of disgrace in worldly life and gave them enjoyment for a time
and had your lord willed those on earth would have believed all of them entirely then o muhammad would you compel the people in order that they become believers
and it is not for a soul to believe except by permission of allah and he will place defilement upon those who will not use reason
say observe what is in the heavens and earth but of no avail will be signs or warners to a people who do not believe
so do they wait except for like what occurred in the days of those who passed on before them say then wait indeed i am with you among those who wait
then we will save our messengers and those who have believed thus it is an obligation upon us that we save the believers
say o muhammad o people if you are in doubt as to my religion then i do not worship those which you worship besides allah but i worship allah who causes your death and i have been commanded to be of the believers
and commanded direct your face toward the religion inclining to truth and never be of those who associate others with allah
and do not invoke besides allah that which neither benefits you nor harms you for if you did then indeed you would be of the wrongdoers
and if allah should touch you with adversity there is no remover of it except him and if he intends for you good then there is no repeller of his bounty he causes it to reach whom he wills of his servants and he is the forgiving the merciful
say o mankind the truth has come to you from your lord so whoever is guided is only guided for the benefit of his soul and whoever goes astray only goes astray in violation against it and i am not over you a manager
and follow what is revealed to you o muhammad and be patient until allah will judge and he is the best of judges
alif lam ra this is a book whose verses are perfected and then presented in detail from one who is wise and acquainted
through a messenger saying do not worship except allah indeed i am to you from him a warner and a bringer of good tidings
and saying seek forgiveness of your lord and repent to him and he will let you enjoy a good provision for a specified term and give every doer of favor his favor but if you turn away then indeed i fear for you the punishment of a great day
to allah is your return and he is over all things competent
unquestionably they the disbelievers turn away their breasts to hide themselves from him unquestionably even when they cover themselves in their clothing allah knows what they conceal and what they declare indeed he is knowing of that within the breasts
and there is no creature on earth but that upon allah is its provision and he knows its place of dwelling and place of storage all is in a clear register
and it is he who created the heavens and the earth in six days and his throne had been upon water that he might test you as to which of you is best in deed but if you say indeed you are resurrected after death those who disbelieve will surely say this is not but obvious magic
and if we hold back from them the punishment for a limited time they will surely say what detains it unquestionably on the day it comes to them it will not be averted from them and they will be enveloped by what they used to ridicule
and if we give man a taste of mercy from us and then we withdraw it from him indeed he is despairing and ungrateful
but if we give him a taste of favor after hardship has touched him he will surely say bad times have left me indeed he is exultant and boastful
except for those who are patient and do righteous deeds those will have forgiveness and great reward
then would you possibly leave out some of what is revealed to you or is your breast constrained by it because they say why has there not been sent down to him a treasure or come with him an angel but you are only a warner and allah is disposer of all things
or do they say he invented it say then bring ten surahs like it that have been invented and call upon for assistance whomever you can besides allah if you should be truthful
and if they do not respond to you then know that the qur an was revealed with the knowledge of allah and that there is no deity except him then would you not be muslims
whoever desires the life of this world and its adornments we fully repay them for their deeds therein and they therein will not be deprived
those are the ones for whom there is not in the hereafter but the fire and lost is what they did therein and worthless is what they used to do
so is one who stands upon a clear evidence from his lord like the aforementioned and a witness from him follows it and before it was the scripture of moses to lead and as mercy those believers in the former revelations believe in the qur an but whoever disbelieves in it from the various factions the fire is his promised destination so be not in doubt about it indeed it is the truth from your lord but most of the people do not believe
and who is more unjust than he who invents a lie about allah those will be presented before their lord and the witnesses will say these are the ones who lied against their lord unquestionably the curse of allah is upon the wrongdoers
who averted people from the way of allah and sought to make it seem deviant while they concerning the hereafter were disbelievers
those were not causing failure to allah on earth nor did they have besides allah any protectors for them the punishment will be multiplied they were not able to hear nor did they see
those are the ones who will have lost themselves and lost from them is what they used to invent
assuredly it is they in the hereafter who will be the greatest losers
indeed they who have believed and done righteous deeds and humbled themselves to their lord those are the companions of paradise they will abide eternally therein
the example of the two parties is like the blind and deaf and the seeing and hearing are they equal in comparison then will you not remember
and we had certainly sent noah to his people saying indeed i am to you a clear warner
that you not worship except allah indeed i fear for you the punishment of a painful day
so the eminent among those who disbelieved from his people said we do not see you but as a man like ourselves and we do not see you followed except by those who are the lowest of us and at first suggestion and we do not see in you over us any merit rather we think you are liars
he said o my people have you considered if i should be upon clear evidence from my lord while he has given me mercy from himself but it has been made unapparent to you should we force it upon you while you are averse to it
and o my people i ask not of you for it any wealth my reward is not but from allah and i am not one to drive away those who have believed indeed they will meet their lord but i see that you are a people behaving ignorantly
and o my people who would protect me from allah if i drove them away then will you not be reminded
and i do not tell you that i have the depositories containing the provision of allah or that i know the unseen nor do i tell you that i am an angel nor do i say of those upon whom your eyes look down that allah will never grant them any good allah is most knowing of what is within their souls indeed i would then be among the wrongdoers
they said o noah you have disputed us and been frequent in dispute of us so bring us what you threaten us if you should be of the truthful
he said allah will only bring it to you if he wills and you will not cause him failure
and my advice will not benefit you although i wished to advise you if allah should intend to put you in error he is your lord and to him you will be returned
or do they say about prophet muhammad he invented it say if i have invented it then upon me is the consequence of my crime but i am innocent of what crimes you commit
and it was revealed to noah that no one will believe from your people except those who have already believed so do not be distressed by what they have been doing
and construct the ship under our observation and our inspiration and do not address me concerning those who have wronged indeed they are to be drowned
and he constructed the ship and whenever an assembly of the eminent of his people passed by him they ridiculed him he said if you ridicule us then we will ridicule you just as you ridicule
and you are going to know who will get a punishment that will disgrace him on earth and upon whom will descend an enduring punishment in the hereafter
so it was until when our command came and the oven overflowed we said load upon the ship of each creature two mates and your family except those about whom the word has preceded and include whoever has believed but none had believed with him except a few
and noah said embark therein in the name of allah is its course and its anchorage indeed my lord is forgiving and merciful
and it sailed with them through waves like mountains and noah called to his son who was apart from them o my son come aboard with us and be not with the disbelievers
but he said i will take refuge on a mountain to protect me from the water noah said there is no protector today from the decree of allah except for whom he gives mercy and the waves came between them and he was among the drowned
and it was said o earth swallow your water and o sky withhold your rain and the water subsided and the matter was accomplished and the ship came to rest on the mountain of judiyy and it was said away with the wrongdoing people
and noah called to his lord and said my lord indeed my son is of my family and indeed your promise is true and you are the most just of judges
he said o noah indeed he is not of your family indeed he is one whose work was other than righteous so ask me not for that about which you have no knowledge indeed i advise you lest you be among the ignorant
noah said my lord i seek refuge in you from asking that of which i have no knowledge and unless you forgive me and have mercy upon me i will be among the losers
it was said o noah disembark in security from us and blessings upon you and upon nations descending from those with you but other nations of them we will grant enjoyment then there will touch them from us a painful punishment
that is from the news of the unseen which we reveal to you o muhammad you knew it not neither you nor your people before this so be patient indeed the best outcome is for the righteous
and to aad we sent their brother hud he said o my people worship allah you have no deity other than him you are not but inventors of falsehood
o my people i do not ask you for it any reward my reward is only from the one who created me then will you not reason
and o my people ask forgiveness of your lord and then repent to him he will send rain from the sky upon you in showers and increase you in strength added to your strength and do not turn away being criminals
they said o hud you have not brought us clear evidence and we are not ones to leave our gods on your say so nor are we believers in you
we only say that some of our gods have possessed you with evil he said indeed i call allah to witness and witness yourselves that i am free from whatever you associate with allah
other than him so plot against me all together then do not give me respite
indeed i have relied upon allah my lord and your lord there is no creature but that he holds its forelock indeed my lord is on a path that is straight
but if they turn away say i have already conveyed that with which i was sent to you my lord will give succession to a people other than you and you will not harm him at all indeed my lord is over all things guardian
and when our command came we saved hud and those who believed with him by mercy from us and we saved them from a harsh punishment
and that was aad who rejected the signs of their lord and disobeyed his messengers and followed the order of every obstinate tyrant
and they were therefore followed in this world with a curse and as well on the day of resurrection unquestionably aad denied their lord then away with aad the people of hud
and to thamud we sent their brother salih he said o my people worship allah you have no deity other than him he has produced you from the earth and settled you in it so ask forgiveness of him and then repent to him indeed my lord is near and responsive
they said o salih you were among us a man of promise before this do you forbid us to worship what our fathers worshipped and indeed we are about that to which you invite us in disquieting doubt
he said o my people have you considered if i should be upon clear evidence from my lord and he has given me mercy from himself who would protect me from allah if i disobeyed him so you would not increase me except in loss
and o my people this is the she camel of allah she is to you a sign so let her feed upon allah s earth and do not touch her with harm or you will be taken by an impending punishment
but they hamstrung her so he said enjoy yourselves in your homes for three days that is a promise not to be denied
so when our command came we saved salih and those who believed with him by mercy from us and saved them from the disgrace of that day indeed it is your lord who is the powerful the exalted in might
and the shriek seized those who had wronged and they became within their homes corpses fallen prone
as if they had never prospered therein unquestionably thamud denied their lord then away with thamud
and certainly did our messengers come to abraham with good tidings they said peace he said peace and did not delay in bringing them a roasted calf
but when he saw their hands not reaching for it he distrusted them and felt from them apprehension they said fear not we have been sent to the people of lot
and his wife was standing and she smiled then we gave her good tidings of isaac and after isaac jacob
she said woe to me shall i give birth while i am an old woman and this my husband is an old man indeed this is an amazing thing
they said are you amazed at the decree of allah may the mercy of allah and his blessings be upon you people of the house indeed he is praiseworthy and honorable
and when the fright had left abraham and the good tidings had reached him he began to argue with us concerning the people of lot
indeed abraham was forbearing grieving and frequently returning to allah
the angels said o abraham give up this plea indeed the command of your lord has come and indeed there will reach them a punishment that cannot be repelled
and when our messengers the angels came to lot he was anguished for them and felt for them great discomfort and said this is a trying day
and his people came hastening to him and before this they had been doing evil deeds he said o my people these are my daughters they are purer for you so fear allah and do not disgrace me concerning my guests is there not among you a man of reason
they said you have already known that we have not concerning your daughters any claim and indeed you know what we want
he said if only i had against you some power or could take refuge in a strong support
the angels said o lot indeed we are messengers of your lord therefore they will never reach you so set out with your family during a portion of the night and let not any among you look back except your wife indeed she will be struck by that which strikes them indeed their appointment is for the morning is not the morning near
so when our command came we made the highest part of the city its lowest and rained upon them stones of layered hard clay which were
marked from your lord and allah s punishment is not from the wrongdoers very far
and to madyan we sent their brother shu ayb he said o my people worship allah you have no deity other than him and do not decrease from the measure and the scale indeed i see you in prosperity but indeed i fear for you the punishment of an all encompassing day
and o my people give full measure and weight in justice and do not deprive the people of their due and do not commit abuse on the earth spreading corruption
what remains lawful from allah is best for you if you would be believers but i am not a guardian over you
they said o shu ayb does your prayer command you that we should leave what our fathers worship or not do with our wealth what we please indeed you are the forbearing the discerning
he said o my people have you considered if i am upon clear evidence from my lord and he has provided me with a good provision from him and i do not intend to differ from you in that which i have forbidden you i only intend reform as much as i am able and my success is not but through allah upon him i have relied and to him i return
and o my people let not your dissension from me cause you to be struck by that similar to what struck the people of noah or the people of hud or the people of salih and the people of lot are not from you far away
and ask forgiveness of your lord and then repent to him indeed my lord is merciful and affectionate
they said o shu ayb we do not understand much of what you say and indeed we consider you among us as weak and if not for your family we would have stoned you to death and you are not to us one respected
he said o my people is my family more respected for power by you than allah but you put him behind your backs in neglect indeed my lord is encompassing of what you do
and o my people work according to your position indeed i am working you are going to know to whom will come a punishment that will disgrace him and who is a liar so watch indeed i am with you a watcher awaiting the outcome
and when our command came we saved shu ayb and those who believed with him by mercy from us and the shriek seized those who had wronged and they became within their homes corpses fallen prone
as if they had never prospered therein then away with madyan as thamud was taken away
and we did certainly send moses with our signs and a clear authority
to pharaoh and his establishment but they followed the command of pharaoh and the command of pharaoh was not at all discerning
he will precede his people on the day of resurrection and lead them into the fire and wretched is the place to which they are led
and they were followed in this world with a curse and on the day of resurrection and wretched is the gift which is given
that is from the news of the cities which we relate to you of them some are still standing and some are as a harvest mowed down
and we did not wrong them but they wronged themselves and they were not availed at all by their gods which they invoked other than allah when there came the command of your lord and they did not increase them in other than ruin
and thus is the seizure of your lord when he seizes the cities while they are committing wrong indeed his seizure is painful and severe
indeed in that is a sign for those who fear the punishment of the hereafter that is a day for which the people will be collected and that is a day which will be witnessed
and we do not delay it except for a limited term
the day it comes no soul will speak except by his permission and among them will be the wretched and the prosperous
as for those who were destined to be wretched they will be in the fire for them therein is violent exhaling and inhaling
they will be abiding therein as long as the heavens and the earth endure except what your lord should will indeed your lord is an effecter of what he intends
and as for those who were destined to be prosperous they will be in paradise abiding therein as long as the heavens and the earth endure except what your lord should will a bestowal uninterrupted
so do not be in doubt o muhammad as to what these polytheists are worshipping they worship not except as their fathers worshipped before and indeed we will give them their share undiminished
and we had certainly given moses the scripture but it came under disagreement and if not for a word that preceded from your lord it would have been judged between them and indeed they are concerning the qur an in disquieting doubt
and indeed each of the believers and disbelievers your lord will fully compensate them for their deeds indeed he is acquainted with what they do
so remain on a right course as you have been commanded you and those who have turned back with you to allah and do not transgress indeed he is seeing of what you do
and do not incline toward those who do wrong lest you be touched by the fire and you would not have other than allah any protectors then you would not be helped
and establish prayer at the two ends of the day and at the approach of the night indeed good deeds do away with misdeeds that is a reminder for those who remember
and be patient for indeed allah does not allow to be lost the reward of those who do good
so why were there not among the generations before you those of enduring discrimination forbidding corruption on earth except a few of those we saved from among them but those who wronged pursued what luxury they were given therein and they were criminals
and your lord would not have destroyed the cities unjustly while their people were reformers
and if your lord had willed he could have made mankind one community but they will not cease to differ
except whom your lord has given mercy and for that he created them but the word of your lord is to be fulfilled that i will surely fill hell with jinn and men all together
and each story we relate to you from the news of the messengers is that by which we make firm your heart and there has come to you in this the truth and an instruction and a reminder for the believers
and say to those who do not believe work according to your position indeed we are working
and wait indeed we are waiting
and to allah belong the unseen aspects of the heavens and the earth and to him will be returned the matter all of it so worship him and rely upon him and your lord is not unaware of that which you do
alif lam ra these are the verses of the clear book
indeed we have sent it down as an arabic qur an that you might understand
we relate to you o muhammad the best of stories in what we have revealed to you of this qur an although you were before it among the unaware
of these stories mention when joseph said to his father o my father indeed i have seen in a dream eleven stars and the sun and the moon i saw them prostrating to me
he said o my son do not relate your vision to your brothers or they will contrive against you a plan indeed satan to man is a manifest enemy
and thus will your lord choose you and teach you the interpretation of narratives and complete his favor upon you and upon the family of jacob as he completed it upon your fathers before abraham and isaac indeed your lord is knowing and wise
certainly were there in joseph and his brothers signs for those who ask
when they said joseph and his brother are more beloved to our father than we while we are a clan indeed our father is in clear error
kill joseph or cast him out to another land the countenance of your father will then be only for you and you will be after that a righteous people
said a speaker among them do not kill joseph but throw him into the bottom of the well some travelers will pick him up if you would do something
they said o our father why do you not entrust us with joseph while indeed we are to him sincere counselors
send him with us tomorrow that he may eat well and play and indeed we will be his guardians
jacob said indeed it saddens me that you should take him and i fear that a wolf would eat him while you are of him unaware
they said if a wolf should eat him while we are a strong clan indeed we would then be losers
so when they took him out and agreed to put him into the bottom of the well but we inspired to him you will surely inform them someday about this affair of theirs while they do not perceive your identity
and they came to their father at night weeping
they said o our father indeed we went racing each other and left joseph with our possessions and a wolf ate him but you would not believe us even if we were truthful
and they brought upon his shirt false blood jacob said rather your souls have enticed you to something so patience is most fitting and allah is the one sought for help against that which you describe
and there came a company of travelers then they sent their water drawer and he let down his bucket he said good news here is a boy and they concealed him taking him as merchandise and allah was knowing of what they did
and they sold him for a reduced price a few dirhams and they were concerning him of those content with little
and the one from egypt who bought him said to his wife make his residence comfortable perhaps he will benefit us or we will adopt him as a son and thus we established joseph in the land that we might teach him the interpretation of events and allah is predominant over his affair but most of the people do not know
and when joseph reached maturity we gave him judgment and knowledge and thus we reward the doers of good
and she in whose house he was sought to seduce him she closed the doors and said come you he said i seek the refuge of allah indeed he is my master who has made good my residence indeed wrongdoers will not succeed
and she certainly determined to seduce him and he would have inclined to her had he not seen the proof of his lord and thus it was that we should avert from him evil and immorality indeed he was of our chosen servants
and they both raced to the door and she tore his shirt from the back and they found her husband at the door she said what is the recompense of one who intended evil for your wife but that he be imprisoned or a painful punishment
joseph said it was she who sought to seduce me and a witness from her family testified if his shirt is torn from the front then she has told the truth and he is of the liars
but if his shirt is torn from the back then she has lied and he is of the truthful
so when her husband saw his shirt torn from the back he said indeed it is of the women s plan indeed your plan is great
joseph ignore this and my wife ask forgiveness for your sin indeed you were of the sinful
and women in the city said the wife of al azeez is seeking to seduce her slave boy he has impassioned her with love indeed we see her to be in clear error
so when she heard of their scheming she sent for them and prepared for them a banquet and gave each one of them a knife and said to joseph come out before them and when they saw him they greatly admired him and cut their hands and said perfect is allah this is not a man this is none but a noble angel
she said that is the one about whom you blamed me and i certainly sought to seduce him but he firmly refused and if he will not do what i order him he will surely be imprisoned and will be of those debased
he said my lord prison is more to my liking than that to which they invite me and if you do not avert from me their plan i might incline toward them and thus be of the ignorant
so his lord responded to him and averted from him their plan indeed he is the hearing the knowing
then it appeared to them after they had seen the signs that al azeez should surely imprison him for a time
and there entered the prison with him two young men one of them said indeed i have seen myself in a dream pressing wine the other said indeed i have seen myself carrying upon my head some bread from which the birds were eating inform us of its interpretation indeed we see you to be of those who do good
he said you will not receive food that is provided to you except that i will inform you of its interpretation before it comes to you that is from what my lord has taught me indeed i have left the religion of a people who do not believe in allah and they in the hereafter are disbelievers
and i have followed the religion of my fathers abraham isaac and jacob and it was not for us to associate anything with allah that is from the favor of allah upon us and upon the people but most of the people are not grateful
o my two companions of prison are separate lords better or allah the one the prevailing
you worship not besides him except mere names you have named them you and your fathers for which allah has sent down no authority legislation is not but for allah he has commanded that you worship not except him that is the correct religion but most of the people do not know
o two companions of prison as for one of you he will give drink to his master of wine but as for the other he will be crucified and the birds will eat from his head the matter has been decreed about which you both inquire
and he said to the one whom he knew would go free mention me before your master but satan made him forget the mention to his master and joseph remained in prison several years
and subsequently the king said indeed i have seen in a dream seven fat cows being eaten by seven that were lean and seven green spikes of grain and others that were dry o eminent ones explain to me my vision if you should interpret visions
they said it is but a mixture of false dreams and we are not learned in the interpretation of dreams
but the one who was freed and remembered after a time said i will inform you of its interpretation so send me forth
he said joseph o man of truth explain to us about seven fat cows eaten by seven that were lean and seven green spikes of grain and others that were dry that i may return to the people perhaps they will know about you
joseph said you will plant for seven years consecutively and what you harvest leave in its spikes except a little from which you will eat
then will come after that seven difficult years which will consume what you saved for them except a little from which you will store
then will come after that a year in which the people will be given rain and in which they will press olives and grapes
and the king said bring him to me but when the messenger came to him joseph said return to your master and ask him what is the case of the women who cut their hands indeed my lord is knowing of their plan
said the king to the women what was your condition when you sought to seduce joseph they said perfect is allah we know about him no evil the wife of al azeez said now the truth has become evident it was i who sought to seduce him and indeed he is of the truthful
that is so al azeez will know that i did not betray him in his absence and that allah does not guide the plan of betrayers
and i do not acquit myself indeed the soul is a persistent enjoiner of evil except those upon which my lord has mercy indeed my lord is forgiving and merciful
and the king said bring him to me i will appoint him exclusively for myself and when he spoke to him he said indeed you are today established in position and trusted
joseph said appoint me over the storehouses of the land indeed i will be a knowing guardian
and thus we established joseph in the land to settle therein wherever he willed we touch with our mercy whom we will and we do not allow to be lost the reward of those who do good
and the reward of the hereafter is better for those who believed and were fearing allah
and the brothers of joseph came seeking food and they entered upon him and he recognized them but he was to them unknown
and when he had furnished them with their supplies he said bring me a brother of yours from your father do not you see that i give full measure and that i am the best of accommodators
but if you do not bring him to me no measure will there be hereafter for you from me nor will you approach me
they said we will attempt to dissuade his father from keeping him and indeed we will do it
and joseph said to his servants put their merchandise into their saddlebags so they might recognize it when they have gone back to their people that perhaps they will again return
so when they returned to their father they said o our father further measure has been denied to us so send with us our brother that we will be given measure and indeed we will be his guardians
he said should i entrust you with him except under coercion as i entrusted you with his brother before but allah is the best guardian and he is the most merciful of the merciful
and when they opened their baggage they found their merchandise returned to them they said o our father what more could we desire this is our merchandise returned to us and we will obtain supplies for our family and protect our brother and obtain an increase of a camel s load that is an easy measurement
jacob said never will i send him with you until you give me a promise by allah that you will bring him back to me unless you should be surrounded by enemies and when they had given their promise he said allah over what we say is witness
and he said o my sons do not enter from one gate but enter from different gates and i cannot avail you against the decree of allah at all the decision is only for allah upon him i have relied and upon him let those who would rely indeed rely
and when they entered from where their father had ordered them it did not avail them against allah at all except it was a need within the soul of jacob which he satisfied and indeed he was a possessor of knowledge because of what we had taught him but most of the people do not know
and when they entered upon joseph he took his brother to himself he said indeed i am your brother so do not despair over what they used to do to me
so when he had furnished them with their supplies he put the gold measuring bowl into the bag of his brother then an announcer called out o caravan indeed you are thieves
they said while approaching them what is it you are missing
they said we are missing the measure of the king and for he who produces it is the reward of a camel s load and i am responsible for it
they said by allah you have certainly known that we did not come to cause corruption in the land and we have not been thieves
the accusers said then what would be its recompense if you should be liars
the brothers said its recompense is that he in whose bag it is found he himself will be its recompense thus do we recompense the wrongdoers
so he began the search with their bags before the bag of his brother then he extracted it from the bag of his brother thus did we plan for joseph he could not have taken his brother within the religion of the king except that allah willed we raise in degrees whom we will but over every possessor of knowledge is one more knowing
they said if he steals a brother of his has stolen before but joseph kept it within himself and did not reveal it to them he said you are worse in position and allah is most knowing of what you describe
they said o azeez indeed he has a father who is an old man so take one of us in place of him indeed we see you as a doer of good
he said i seek the refuge of allah to prevent that we take except him with whom we found our possession indeed we would then be unjust
so when they had despaired of him they secluded themselves in private consultation the eldest of them said do you not know that your father has taken upon you an oath by allah and that before you failed in your duty to joseph so i will never leave this land until my father permits me or allah decides for me and he is the best of judges
return to your father and say o our father indeed your son has stolen and we did not testify except to what we knew and we were not witnesses of the unseen
and ask the city in which we were and the caravan in which we came and indeed we are truthful
jacob said rather your souls have enticed you to something so patience is most fitting perhaps allah will bring them to me all together indeed it is he who is the knowing the wise
and he turned away from them and said oh my sorrow over joseph and his eyes became white from grief for he was of that a suppressor
they said by allah you will not cease remembering joseph until you become fatally ill or become of those who perish
he said i only complain of my suffering and my grief to allah and i know from allah that which you do not know
o my sons go and find out about joseph and his brother and despair not of relief from allah indeed no one despairs of relief from allah except the disbelieving people
so when they entered upon joseph they said o azeez adversity has touched us and our family and we have come with goods poor in quality but give us full measure and be charitable to us indeed allah rewards the charitable
he said do you know what you did with joseph and his brother when you were ignorant
they said are you indeed joseph he said i am joseph and this is my brother allah has certainly favored us indeed he who fears allah and is patient then indeed allah does not allow to be lost the reward of those who do good
they said by allah certainly has allah preferred you over us and indeed we have been sinners
he said no blame will there be upon you today allah will forgive you and he is the most merciful of the merciful
take this my shirt and cast it over the face of my father he will become seeing and bring me your family all together
and when the caravan departed from egypt their father said indeed i find the smell of joseph and would say that he was alive if you did not think me weakened in mind
they said by allah indeed you are in your same old error
and when the bearer of good tidings arrived he cast it over his face and he returned once again seeing he said did i not tell you that i know from allah that which you do not know
they said o our father ask for us forgiveness of our sins indeed we have been sinners
he said i will ask forgiveness for you from my lord indeed it is he who is the forgiving the merciful
and when they entered upon joseph he took his parents to himself and said enter egypt allah willing safe and secure
and he raised his parents upon the throne and they bowed to him in prostration and he said o my father this is the explanation of my vision of before my lord has made it reality and he was certainly good to me when he took me out of prison and brought you here from bedouin life after satan had induced estrangement between me and my brothers indeed my lord is subtle in what he wills indeed it is he who is the knowing the wise
my lord you have given me something of sovereignty and taught me of the interpretation of dreams creator of the heavens and earth you are my protector in this world and in the hereafter cause me to die a muslim and join me with the righteous
that is from the news of the unseen which we reveal o muhammad to you and you were not with them when they put together their plan while they conspired
and most of the people although you strive for it are not believers
and you do not ask of them for it any payment it is not except a reminder to the worlds
and how many a sign within the heavens and earth do they pass over while they therefrom are turning away
and most of them believe not in allah except while they associate others with him
then do they feel secure that there will not come to them an overwhelming aspect of the punishment of allah or that the hour will not come upon them suddenly while they do not perceive
say this is my way i invite to allah with insight i and those who follow me and exalted is allah and i am not of those who associate others with him
and we sent not before you as messengers except men to whom we revealed from among the people of cities so have they not traveled through the earth and observed how was the end of those before them and the home of the hereafter is best for those who fear allah then will you not reason
they continued until when the messengers despaired and were certain that they had been denied there came to them our victory and whoever we willed was saved and our punishment cannot be repelled from the people who are criminals
there was certainly in their stories a lesson for those of understanding never was the qur an a narration invented but a confirmation of what was before it and a detailed explanation of all things and guidance and mercy for a people who believe
alif lam meem ra these are the verses of the book and what has been revealed to you from your lord is the truth but most of the people do not believe
it is allah who erected the heavens without pillars that you can see then he established himself above the throne and made subject the sun and the moon each running its course for a specified term he arranges each matter he details the signs that you may of the meeting with your lord be certain
and it is he who spread the earth and placed therein firmly set mountains and rivers and from all of the fruits he made therein two mates he causes the night to cover the day indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought
and within the land are neighboring plots and gardens of grapevines and crops and palm trees growing several from a root or otherwise watered with one water but we make some of them exceed others in quality of fruit indeed in that are signs for a people who reason
and if you are astonished o muhammad then astonishing is their saying when we are dust will we indeed be brought into a new creation those are the ones who have disbelieved in their lord and those will have shackles upon their necks and those are the companions of the fire they will abide therein eternally
they impatiently urge you to bring about evil before good while there has already occurred before them similar punishments to what they demand and indeed your lord is full of forgiveness for the people despite their wrongdoing and indeed your lord is severe in penalty
and those who disbelieved say why has a sign not been sent down to him from his lord you are only a warner and for every people is a guide
allah knows what every female carries and what the wombs lose prematurely or exceed and everything with him is by due measure
he is knower of the unseen and the witnessed the grand the exalted
it is the same to him concerning you whether one conceals his speech or one publicizes it and whether one is hidden by night or conspicuous among others by day
for each one are successive angels before and behind him who protect him by the decree of allah indeed allah will not change the condition of a people until they change what is in themselves and when allah intends for a people ill there is no repelling it and there is not for them besides him any patron
it is he who shows you lightening causing fear and aspiration and generates the heavy clouds
and the thunder exalts allah with praise of him and the angels as well from fear of him and he sends thunderbolts and strikes therewith whom he wills while they dispute about allah and he is severe in assault
to him alone is the supplication of truth and those they call upon besides him do not respond to them with a thing except as one who stretches his hands toward water from afar calling it to reach his mouth but it will not reach it thus and the supplication of the disbelievers is not but in error i e futility
and to allah prostrates whoever is within the heavens and the earth willingly or by compulsion and their shadows as well in the mornings and the afternoons
say who is lord of the heavens and earth say allah say have you then taken besides him allies not possessing even for themselves any benefit or any harm say is the blind equivalent to the seeing or is darkness equivalent to light or have they attributed to allah partners who created like his creation so that the creation of each seemed similar to them say allah is the creator of all things and he is the one the prevailing
he sends down from the sky rain and valleys flow according to their capacity and the torrent carries a rising foam and from that ore which they heat in the fire desiring adornments and utensils is a foam like it thus allah presents the example of truth and falsehood as for the foam it vanishes being cast off but as for that which benefits the people it remains on the earth thus does allah present examples
for those who have responded to their lord is the best reward but those who did not respond to him if they had all that is in the earth entirely and the like of it with it they would attempt to ransom themselves thereby those will have the worst account and their refuge is hell and wretched is the resting place
then is he who knows that what has been revealed to you from your lord is the truth like one who is blind they will only be reminded who are people of understanding
those who fulfill the covenant of allah and do not break the contract
and those who join that which allah has ordered to be joined and fear their lord and are afraid of the evil of their account
and those who are patient seeking the countenance of their lord and establish prayer and spend from what we have provided for them secretly and publicly and prevent evil with good those will have the good consequence of this home
gardens of perpetual residence they will enter them with whoever were righteous among their fathers their spouses and their descendants and the angels will enter upon them from every gate saying
peace be upon you for what you patiently endured and excellent is the final home
but those who break the covenant of allah after contracting it and sever that which allah has ordered to be joined and spread corruption on earth for them is the curse and they will have the worst home
allah extends provision for whom he wills and restricts it and they rejoice in the worldly life while the worldly life is not compared to the hereafter except brief enjoyment
and those who disbelieved say why has a sign not been sent down to him from his lord say o muhammad indeed allah leaves astray whom he wills and guides to himself whoever turns back to him
those who have believed and whose hearts are assured by the remembrance of allah unquestionably by the remembrance of allah hearts are assured
those who have believed and done righteous deeds a good state is theirs and a good return
thus have we sent you to a community before which other communities have passed on so you might recite to them that which we revealed to you while they disbelieve in the most merciful say he is my lord there is no deity except him upon him i rely and to him is my return
and if there was any qur an by which the mountains would be removed or the earth would be broken apart or the dead would be made to speak it would be this qur an but to allah belongs the affair entirely then have those who believed not accepted that had allah willed he would have guided the people all of them and those who disbelieve do not cease to be struck for what they have done by calamity or it will descend near their home until there comes the promise of allah indeed allah does not fail in his promise
and already were other messengers ridiculed before you and i extended the time of those who disbelieved then i seized them and how terrible was my penalty
then is he who is a maintainer of every soul knowing what it has earned like any other but to allah they have attributed partners say name them or do you inform him of that which he knows not upon the earth or of what is apparent of speech rather their own plan has been made attractive to those who disbelieve and they have been averted from the way and whomever allah leaves astray there will be for him no guide
for them will be punishment in the life of this world and the punishment of the hereafter is more severe and they will not have from allah any protector
the example of paradise which the righteous have been promised is that beneath it rivers flow its fruit is lasting and its shade that is the consequence for the righteous and the consequence for the disbelievers is the fire
and the believers among those to whom we have given the previous scripture rejoice at what has been revealed to you o muhammad but among the opposing factions are those who deny part of it say i have only been commanded to worship allah and not associate anything with him to him i invite and to him is my return
and thus we have revealed it as an arabic legislation and if you should follow their inclinations after what has come to you of knowledge you would not have against allah any ally or any protector
and we have already sent messengers before you and assigned to them wives and descendants and it was not for a messenger to come with a sign except by permission of allah for every term is a decree
allah eliminates what he wills or confirms and with him is the mother of the book
and whether we show you part of what we promise them or take you in death upon you is only the duty of notification and upon us is the account
have they not seen that we set upon the land reducing it from its borders and allah decides there is no adjuster of his decision and he is swift in account
and those before them had plotted but to allah belongs the plan entirely he knows what every soul earns and the disbelievers will know for whom is the final home
and those who have disbelieved say you are not a messenger say o muhammad sufficient is allah as witness between me and you and the witness of whoever has knowledge of the scripture
alif lam ra this is a book which we have revealed to you o muhammad that you might bring mankind out of darknesses into the light by permission of their lord to the path of the exalted in might the praiseworthy
allah to whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth and woe to the disbelievers from a severe punishment
the ones who prefer the worldly life over the hereafter and avert people from the way of allah seeking to make it seem deviant those are in extreme error
and we did not send any messenger except speaking in the language of his people to state clearly for them and allah sends astray thereby whom he wills and guides whom he wills and he is the exalted in might the wise
and we certainly sent moses with our signs saying bring out your people from darknesses into the light and remind them of the days of allah indeed in that are signs for everyone patient and grateful
and recall o children of israel when moses said to his people remember the favor of allah upon you when he saved you from the people of pharaoh who were afflicting you with the worst torment and were slaughtering your newborn sons and keeping your females alive and in that was a great trial from your lord
and remember when your lord proclaimed if you are grateful i will surely increase you in favor but if you deny indeed my punishment is severe
and moses said if you should disbelieve you and whoever is on the earth entirely indeed allah is free of need and praiseworthy
has there not reached you the news of those before you the people of noah and aad and thamud and those after them no one knows them but allah their messengers brought them clear proofs but they returned their hands to their mouths and said indeed we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent and indeed we are about that to which you invite us in disquieting doubt
their messengers said can there be doubt about allah creator of the heavens and earth he invites you that he may forgive you of your sins and he delays your death for a specified term they said you are not but men like us who wish to avert us from what our fathers were worshipping so bring us a clear authority
their messengers said to them we are only men like you but allah confers favor upon whom he wills of his servants it has never been for us to bring you evidence except by permission of allah and upon allah let the believers rely
and why should we not rely upon allah while he has guided us to our good ways and we will surely be patient against whatever harm you should cause us and upon allah let those who would rely indeed rely
and those who disbelieved said to their messengers we will surely drive you out of our land or you must return to our religion so their lord inspired to them we will surely destroy the wrongdoers
and we will surely cause you to dwell in the land after them that is for he who fears my position and fears my threat
and they requested victory from allah and disappointed therefore was every obstinate tyrant
before him is hell and he will be given a drink of purulent water
he will gulp it but will hardly be able to swallow it and death will come to him from everywhere but he is not to die and before him is a massive punishment
the example of those who disbelieve in their lord is that their deeds are like ashes which the wind blows forcefully on a stormy day they are unable to keep from what they earned a single thing that is what is extreme error
have you not seen that allah created the heavens and the earth in truth if he wills he can do away with you and produce a new creation
and that is not difficult for allah
and they will come out for judgement before allah all together and the weak will say to those who were arrogant indeed we were your followers so can you avail us anything against the punishment of allah they will say if allah had guided us we would have guided you it is all the same for us whether we show intolerance or are patient there is for us no place of escape
and satan will say when the matter has been concluded indeed allah had promised you the promise of truth and i promised you but i betrayed you but i had no authority over you except that i invited you and you responded to me so do not blame me but blame yourselves i cannot be called to your aid nor can you be called to my aid indeed i deny your association of me with allah before indeed for the wrongdoers is a painful punishment
and those who believed and did righteous deeds will be admitted to gardens beneath which rivers flow abiding eternally therein by permission of their lord and their greeting therein will be peace
have you not considered how allah presents an example making a good word like a good tree whose root is firmly fixed and its branches high in the sky
it produces its fruit all the time by permission of its lord and allah presents examples for the people that perhaps they will be reminded
and the example of a bad word is like a bad tree uprooted from the surface of the earth not having any stability
allah keeps firm those who believe with the firm word in worldly life and in the hereafter and allah sends astray the wrongdoers and allah does what he wills
have you not considered those who exchanged the favor of allah for disbelief and settled their people in the home of ruin
it is hell which they will enter to burn and wretched is the settlement
and they have attributed to allah equals to mislead people from his way say enjoy yourselves for indeed your destination is the fire
o muhammad tell my servants who have believed to establish prayer and spend from what we have provided them secretly and publicly before a day comes in which there will be no exchange nor any friendships
it is allah who created the heavens and the earth and sent down rain from the sky and produced thereby some fruits as provision for you and subjected for you the ships to sail through the sea by his command and subjected for you the rivers
and he subjected for you the sun and the moon continuous in orbit and subjected for you the night and the day
and he gave you from all you asked of him and if you should count the favor of allah you could not enumerate them indeed mankind is generally most unjust and ungrateful
and mention o muhammad when abraham said my lord make this city makkah secure and keep me and my sons away from worshipping idols
my lord indeed they have led astray many among the people so whoever follows me then he is of me and whoever disobeys me indeed you are yet forgiving and merciful
our lord i have settled some of my descendants in an uncultivated valley near your sacred house our lord that they may establish prayer so make hearts among the people incline toward them and provide for them from the fruits that they might be grateful
our lord indeed you know what we conceal and what we declare and nothing is hidden from allah on the earth or in the heaven
praise to allah who has granted to me in old age ishmael and isaac indeed my lord is the hearer of supplication
my lord make me an establisher of prayer and many from my descendants our lord and accept my supplication
our lord forgive me and my parents and the believers the day the account is established
and never think that allah is unaware of what the wrongdoers do he only delays them for a day when eyes will stare in horror
racing ahead their heads raised up their glance does not come back to them and their hearts are void
and o muhammad warn the people of a day when the punishment will come to them and those who did wrong will say our lord delay us for a short term we will answer your call and follow the messengers but it will be said had you not sworn before that for you there would be no cessation
and you lived among the dwellings of those who wronged themselves and it had become clear to you how we dealt with them and we presented for you many examples
and they had planned their plan but with allah is recorded their plan even if their plan had been sufficient to do away with the mountains
so never think that allah will fail in his promise to his messengers indeed allah is exalted in might and owner of retribution
it will be on the day the earth will be replaced by another earth and the heavens as well and all creatures will come out before allah the one the prevailing
and you will see the criminals that day bound together in shackles
their garments of liquid pitch and their faces covered by the fire
so that allah will recompense every soul for what it earned indeed allah is swift in account
this qur an is notification for the people that they may be warned thereby and that they may know that he is but one god and that those of understanding will be reminded
alif lam ra these are the verses of the book and a clear qur an
perhaps those who disbelieve will wish that they had been muslims
let them eat and enjoy themselves and be diverted by false hope for they are going to know
and we did not destroy any city but that for it was a known decree
no nation will precede its term nor will they remain thereafter
and they say o you upon whom the message has been sent down indeed you are mad
why do you not bring us the angels if you should be among the truthful
we do not send down the angels except with truth and the disbelievers would not then be reprieved
indeed it is we who sent down the qur an and indeed we will be its guardian
and we had certainly sent messengers before you o muhammad among the sects of the former peoples
and no messenger would come to them except that they ridiculed him
thus do we insert denial into the hearts of the criminals
they will not believe in it while there has already occurred the precedent of the former peoples
and even if we opened to them a gate from the heaven and they continued therein to ascend
they would say our eyes have only been dazzled rather we are a people affected by magic
and we have placed within the heaven great stars and have beautified it for the observers
and we have protected it from every devil expelled from the mercy of allah
except one who steals a hearing and is pursued by a clear burning flame
and the earth we have spread it and cast therein firmly set mountains and caused to grow therein something of every well balanced thing
and we have made for you therein means of living and for those for whom you are not providers
and there is not a thing but that with us are its depositories and we do not send it down except according to a known measure
and we have sent the fertilizing winds and sent down water from the sky and given you drink from it and you are not its retainers
and indeed it is we who give life and cause death and we are the inheritor
and we have already known the preceding generations among you and we have already known the later ones to come
and indeed your lord will gather them indeed he is wise and knowing
and we did certainly create man out of clay from an altered black mud
and the jinn we created before from scorching fire
and mention o muhammad when your lord said to the angels i will create a human being out of clay from an altered black mud
and when i have proportioned him and breathed into him of my created soul then fall down to him in prostration
so the angels prostrated all of them entirely
except iblees he refused to be with those who prostrated
allah said o iblees what is the matter with you that you are not with those who prostrate
he said never would i prostrate to a human whom you created out of clay from an altered black mud
allah said then get out of it for indeed you are expelled
and indeed upon you is the curse until the day of recompense
he said my lord then reprieve me until the day they are resurrected
allah said so indeed you are of those reprieved
until the day of the time well known
iblees said my lord because you have put me in error i will surely make disobedience attractive to them on earth and i will mislead them all
except among them your chosen servants
allah said this is a path of return to me that is straight
indeed my servants no authority will you have over them except those who follow you of the deviators
and indeed hell is the promised place for them all
it has seven gates for every gate is of them a portion designated
indeed the righteous will be within gardens and springs
having been told enter it in peace safe and secure
and we will remove whatever is in their breasts of resentment so they will be brothers on thrones facing each other
no fatigue will touch them therein nor from it will they ever be removed
o muhammad inform my servants that it is i who am the forgiving the merciful
and that it is my punishment which is the painful punishment
and inform them about the guests of abraham
when they entered upon him and said peace abraham said indeed we are fearful of you
the angels said fear not indeed we give you good tidings of a learned boy
he said have you given me good tidings although old age has come upon me then of what wonder do you inform
they said we have given you good tidings in truth so do not be of the despairing
he said and who despairs of the mercy of his lord except for those astray
abraham said then what is your business here o messengers
they said indeed we have been sent to a people of criminals
except the family of lot indeed we will save them all
except his wife allah decreed that she is of those who remain behind
and when the messengers came to the family of lot
he said indeed you are people unknown
they said but we have come to you with that about which they were disputing
and we have come to you with truth and indeed we are truthful
so set out with your family during a portion of the night and follow behind them and let not anyone among you look back and continue on to where you are commanded
and we conveyed to him the decree of that matter that those sinners would be eliminated by early morning
and the people of the city came rejoicing
lot said indeed these are my guests so do not shame me
and fear allah and do not disgrace me
they said have we not forbidden you from protecting people
lot said these are my daughters if you would be doers of lawful marriage
by your life o muhammad indeed they were in their intoxication wandering blindly
so the shriek seized them at sunrise
and we made the highest part of the city its lowest and rained upon them stones of hard clay
indeed in that are signs for those who discern
and indeed those cities are situated on an established road
indeed in that is a sign for the believers
and the companions of the thicket were also wrongdoers
so we took retribution from them and indeed both cities are on a clear highway
and certainly did the companions of thamud deny the messengers
and we gave them our signs but from them they were turning away
and they used to carve from the mountains houses feeling secure
but the shriek seized them at early morning
so nothing availed them from what they used to earn
and we have not created the heavens and earth and that between them except in truth and indeed the hour is coming so forgive with gracious forgiveness
indeed your lord he is the knowing creator
and we have certainly given you o muhammad seven of the often repeated verses and the great qur an
do not extend your eyes toward that by which we have given enjoyment to certain categories of the disbelievers and do not grieve over them and lower your wing to the believers
and say indeed i am the clear warner
just as we had revealed scriptures to the separators
who have made the qur an into portions
so by your lord we will surely question them all
about what they used to do
then declare what you are commanded and turn away from the polytheists
indeed we are sufficient for you against the mockers
who make equal with allah another deity but they are going to know
and we already know that your breast is constrained by what they say
so exalt allah with praise of your lord and be of those who prostrate to him
and worship your lord until there comes to you the certainty death
the command of allah is coming so be not impatient for it exalted is he and high above what they associate with him
he sends down the angels with the inspiration of his command upon whom he wills of his servants telling them warn that there is no deity except me so fear me
he created the heavens and earth in truth high is he above what they associate with him
he created man from a sperm drop then at once he is a clear adversary
and the grazing livestock he has created for you in them is warmth and numerous benefits and from them you eat
and for you in them is the enjoyment of beauty when you bring them in for the evening and when you send them out to pasture
and they carry your loads to a land you could not have reached except with difficulty to yourselves indeed your lord is kind and merciful
and he created the horses mules and donkeys for you to ride and as adornment and he creates that which you do not know
and upon allah is the direction of the right way and among the various paths are those deviating and if he willed he could have guided you all
it is he who sends down rain from the sky from it is drink and from it is foliage in which you pasture animals
he causes to grow for you thereby the crops olives palm trees grapevines and from all the fruits indeed in that is a sign for a people who give thought
and he has subjected for you the night and day and the sun and moon and the stars are subjected by his command indeed in that are signs for a people who reason
and he has subjected whatever he multiplied for you on the earth of varying colors indeed in that is a sign for a people who remember
and it is he who subjected the sea for you to eat from it tender meat and to extract from it ornaments which you wear and you see the ships plowing through it and he subjected it that you may seek of his bounty and perhaps you will be grateful
and he has cast into the earth firmly set mountains lest it shift with you and made rivers and roads that you may be guided
and landmarks and by the stars they are also guided
then is he who creates like one who does not create so will you not be reminded
and if you should count the favors of allah you could not enumerate them indeed allah is forgiving and merciful
and allah knows what you conceal and what you declare
and those they invoke other than allah create nothing and they themselves are created
they are in fact dead not alive and they do not perceive when they will be resurrected
your god is one god but those who do not believe in the hereafter their hearts are disapproving and they are arrogant
assuredly allah knows what they conceal and what they declare indeed he does not like the arrogant
and when it is said to them what has your lord sent down they say legends of the former peoples
that they may bear their own burdens in full on the day of resurrection and some of the burdens of those whom they misguide without knowledge unquestionably evil is that which they bear
those before them had already plotted but allah came at their building from the foundations so the roof fell upon them from above them and the punishment came to them from where they did not perceive
then on the day of resurrection he will disgrace them and say where are my partners for whom you used to oppose the believers those who were given knowledge will say indeed disgrace this day and evil are upon the disbelievers
the ones whom the angels take in death while wronging themselves and who then offer submission saying we were not doing any evil but yes indeed allah is knowing of what you used to do
so enter the gates of hell to abide eternally therein and how wretched is the residence of the arrogant
and it will be said to those who feared allah what did your lord send down they will say that which is good for those who do good in this world is good and the home of the hereafter is better and how excellent is the home of the righteous
gardens of perpetual residence which they will enter beneath which rivers flow they will have therein whatever they wish thus does allah reward the righteous
the ones whom the angels take in death being good and pure the angels will say peace be upon you enter paradise for what you used to do
do the disbelievers await anything except that the angels should come to them or there comes the command of your lord thus did those do before them and allah wronged them not but they had been wronging themselves
so they were struck by the evil consequences of what they did and were enveloped by what they used to ridicule
and those who associate others with allah say if allah had willed we would not have worshipped anything other than him neither we nor our fathers nor would we have forbidden anything through other than him thus did those do before them so is there upon the messengers except the duty of clear notification
and we certainly sent into every nation a messenger saying worship allah and avoid taghut and among them were those whom allah guided and among them were those upon whom error was deservedly decreed so proceed through the earth and observe how was the end of the deniers
even if you should strive for their guidance o muhammad indeed allah does not guide those he sends astray and they will have no helpers
and they swear by allah their strongest oaths that allah will not resurrect one who dies but yes it is a true promise binding upon him but most of the people do not know
it is so he will make clear to them the truth of that wherein they differ and so those who have disbelieved may know that they were liars
indeed our word to a thing when we intend it is but that we say to it be and it is
and those who emigrated for the cause of allah after they had been wronged we will surely settle them in this world in a good place but the reward of the hereafter is greater if only they could know
they are those who endured patiently and upon their lord relied
and we sent not before you except men to whom we revealed our message so ask the people of the message if you do not know
we sent them with clear proofs and written ordinances and we revealed to you the message that you may make clear to the people what was sent down to them and that they might give thought
then do those who have planned evil deeds feel secure that allah will not cause the earth to swallow them or that the punishment will not come upon them from where they do not perceive
or that he would not seize them during their usual activity and they could not cause failure
or that he would not seize them gradually in a state of dread but indeed your lord is kind and merciful
have they not considered what things allah has created their shadows incline to the right and to the left prostrating to allah while they are humble
and to allah prostrates whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth of creatures and the angels as well and they are not arrogant
they fear their lord above them and they do what they are commanded
and allah has said do not take for yourselves two deities he is but one god so fear only me
and to him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth and to him is due worship constantly then is it other than allah that you fear
and whatever you have of favor it is from allah then when adversity touches you to him you cry for help
then when he removes the adversity from you at once a party of you associates others with their lord
so they will deny what we have given them then enjoy yourselves for you are going to know
and they assign to what they do not know a portion of that which we have provided them by allah you will surely be questioned about what you used to invent
and they attribute to allah daughters exalted is he and for them is what they desire
and when one of them is informed of the birth of a female his face becomes dark and he suppresses grief
he hides himself from the people because of the ill of which he has been informed should he keep it in humiliation or bury it in the ground unquestionably evil is what they decide
for those who do not believe in the hereafter is the description of evil and for allah is the highest attribute and he is exalted in might the wise
and if allah were to impose blame on the people for their wrongdoing he would not have left upon the earth any creature but he defers them for a specified term and when their term has come they will not remain behind an hour nor will they precede it
and they attribute to allah that which they dislike and their tongues assert the lie that they will have the best from him assuredly they will have the fire and they will be therein neglected
by allah we did certainly send messengers to nations before you but satan made their deeds attractive to them and he is the disbelievers ally today as well and they will have a painful punishment
and we have not revealed to you the book o muhammad except for you to make clear to them that wherein they have differed and as guidance and mercy for a people who believe
and allah has sent down rain from the sky and given life thereby to the earth after its lifelessness indeed in that is a sign for a people who listen
and indeed for you in grazing livestock is a lesson we give you drink from what is in their bellies between excretion and blood pure milk palatable to drinkers
and from the fruits of the palm trees and grapevines you take intoxicant and good provision indeed in that is a sign for a people who reason
and your lord inspired to the bee take for yourself among the mountains houses and among the trees and in that which they construct
then eat from all the fruits and follow the ways of your lord laid down for you there emerges from their bellies a drink varying in colors in which there is healing for people indeed in that is a sign for a people who give thought
and allah created you then he will take you in death and among you is he who is reversed to the most decrepit old age so that he will not know after having had knowledge a thing indeed allah is knowing and competent
and allah has favored some of you over others in provision but those who were favored would not hand over their provision to those whom their right hands possess so they would be equal to them therein then is it the favor of allah they reject
and allah has made for you from yourselves mates and has made for you from your mates sons and grandchildren and has provided for you from the good things then in falsehood do they believe and in the favor of allah they disbelieve
and they worship besides allah that which does not possess for them the power of provision from the heavens and the earth at all and in fact they are unable
so do not assert similarities to allah indeed allah knows and you do not know
allah presents an example a slave who is owned and unable to do a thing and he to whom we have provided from us good provision so he spends from it secretly and publicly can they be equal praise to allah but most of them do not know
and allah presents an example of two men one of them dumb and unable to do a thing while he is a burden to his guardian wherever he directs him he brings no good is he equal to one who commands justice while he is on a straight path
and to allah belongs the unseen aspects of the heavens and the earth and the command for the hour is not but as a glance of the eye or even nearer indeed allah is over all things competent
and allah has extracted you from the wombs of your mothers not knowing a thing and he made for you hearing and vision and intellect that perhaps you would be grateful
do they not see the birds controlled in the atmosphere of the sky none holds them up except allah indeed in that are signs for a people who believe
and allah has made for you from your homes a place of rest and made for you from the hides of the animals tents which you find light on your day of travel and your day of encampment and from their wool fur and hair is furnishing and enjoyment for a time
and allah has made for you from that which he has created shadows and has made for you from the mountains shelters and has made for you garments which protect you from the heat and garments which protect you from your enemy in battle thus does he complete his favor upon you that you might submit to him
but if they turn away o muhammad then only upon you is responsibility for clear notification
they recognize the favor of allah then they deny it and most of them are disbelievers
and mention the day when we will resurrect from every nation a witness then it will not be permitted to the disbelievers to apologize or make excuses nor will they be asked to appease allah
and when those who wronged see the punishment it will not be lightened for them nor will they be reprieved
and when those who associated others with allah see their partners they will say our lord these are our partners to you whom we used to invoke besides you but they will throw at them the statement indeed you are liars
and they will impart to allah that day their submission and lost from them is what they used to invent
those who disbelieved and averted others from the way of allah we will increase them in punishment over their punishment for what corruption they were causing
and mention the day when we will resurrect among every nation a witness over them from themselves and we will bring you o muhammad as a witness over your nation and we have sent down to you the book as clarification for all things and as guidance and mercy and good tidings for the muslims
indeed allah orders justice and good conduct and giving to relatives and forbids immorality and bad conduct and oppression he admonishes you that perhaps you will be reminded
and fulfill the covenant of allah when you have taken it o believers and do not break oaths after their confirmation while you have made allah over you a witness indeed allah knows what you do
and do not be like she who untwisted her spun thread after it was strong by taking your oaths as means of deceit between you because one community is more plentiful in number or wealth than another community allah only tries you thereby and he will surely make clear to you on the day of resurrection that over which you used to differ
and if allah had willed he could have made you of one religion but he causes to stray whom he wills and guides whom he wills and you will surely be questioned about what you used to do
and do not take your oaths as means of deceit between you lest a foot slip after it was once firm and you would taste evil in this world for what people you diverted from the way of allah and you would have in the hereafter a great punishment
and do not exchange the covenant of allah for a small price indeed what is with allah is best for you if only you could know
whatever you have will end but what allah has is lasting and we will surely give those who were patient their reward according to the best of what they used to do
whoever does righteousness whether male or female while he is a believer we will surely cause him to live a good life and we will surely give them their reward in the hereafter according to the best of what they used to do
so when you recite the qur an first seek refuge in allah from satan the expelled from his mercy
indeed there is for him no authority over those who have believed and rely upon their lord
his authority is only over those who take him as an ally and those who through him associate others with allah
and when we substitute a verse in place of a verse and allah is most knowing of what he sends down they say you o muhammad are but an inventor of lies but most of them do not know
say o muhammad the pure spirit has brought it down from your lord in truth to make firm those who believe and as guidance and good tidings to the muslims
and we certainly know that they say it is only a human being who teaches the prophet the tongue of the one they refer to is foreign and this qur an is in a clear arabic language
indeed those who do not believe in the verses of allah allah will not guide them and for them is a painful punishment
they only invent falsehood who do not believe in the verses of allah and it is those who are the liars
whoever disbelieves in allah after his belief except for one who is forced to renounce his religion while his heart is secure in faith but those who willingly open their breasts to disbelief upon them is wrath from allah and for them is a great punishment
that is because they preferred the worldly life over the hereafter and that allah does not guide the disbelieving people
those are the ones over whose hearts and hearing and vision allah has sealed and it is those who are the heedless
assuredly it is they in the hereafter who will be the losers
then indeed your lord to those who emigrated after they had been compelled to renounce their religion and thereafter fought for the cause of allah and were patient indeed your lord after that is forgiving and merciful
on the day when every soul will come disputing for itself and every soul will be fully compensated for what it did and they will not be wronged
and allah presents an example a city which was safe and secure its provision coming to it in abundance from every location but it denied the favors of allah so allah made it taste the envelopment of hunger and fear for what they had been doing
and there had certainly come to them a messenger from among themselves but they denied him so punishment overtook them while they were wrongdoers
then eat of what allah has provided for you which is lawful and good and be grateful for the favor of allah if it is indeed him that you worship
he has only forbidden to you dead animals blood the flesh of swine and that which has been dedicated to other than allah but whoever is forced by necessity neither desiring it nor transgressing its limit then indeed allah is forgiving and merciful
and do not say about what your tongues assert of untruth this is lawful and this is unlawful to invent falsehood about allah indeed those who invent falsehood about allah will not succeed
it is but a brief enjoyment and they will have a painful punishment
and to those who are jews we have prohibited that which we related to you before and we did not wrong them thereby but they were wronging themselves
then indeed your lord to those who have done wrong out of ignorance and then repent after that and correct themselves indeed your lord thereafter is forgiving and merciful
indeed abraham was a comprehensive leader devoutly obedient to allah inclining toward truth and he was not of those who associate others with allah
he was grateful for his favors allah chose him and guided him to a straight path
and we gave him good in this world and indeed in the hereafter he will be among the righteous
then we revealed to you o muhammad to follow the religion of abraham inclining toward truth and he was not of those who associate with allah
the sabbath was only appointed for those who differed over it and indeed your lord will judge between them on the day of resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ
invite to the way of your lord with wisdom and good instruction and argue with them in a way that is best indeed your lord is most knowing of who has strayed from his way and he is most knowing of who is rightly guided
and if you punish an enemy o believers punish with an equivalent of that with which you were harmed but if you are patient it is better for those who are patient
and be patient o muhammad and your patience is not but through allah and do not grieve over them and do not be in distress over what they conspire
indeed allah is with those who fear him and those who are doers of good
exalted is he who took his servant by night from al masjid al haram to al masjid al aqsa whose surroundings we have blessed to show him of our signs indeed he is the hearing the seeing
and we gave moses the scripture and made it a guidance for the children of israel that you not take other than me as disposer of affairs
o descendants of those we carried in the ship with noah indeed he was a grateful servant
and we conveyed to the children of israel in the scripture that you will surely cause corruption on the earth twice and you will surely reach a degree of great haughtiness
so when the time of promise came for the first of them we sent against you servants of ours those of great military might and they probed even into the homes and it was a promise fulfilled
then we gave back to you a return victory over them and we reinforced you with wealth and sons and made you more numerous in manpower
and said if you do good you do good for yourselves and if you do evil you do it to yourselves then when the final promise came we sent your enemies to sadden your faces and to enter the temple in jerusalem as they entered it the first time and to destroy what they had taken over with total destruction
then allah said it is expected if you repent that your lord will have mercy upon you but if you return to sin we will return to punishment and we have made hell for the disbelievers a prison bed
indeed this qur an guides to that which is most suitable and gives good tidings to the believers who do righteous deeds that they will have a great reward
and that those who do not believe in the hereafter we have prepared for them a painful punishment
and man supplicates for evil as he supplicates for good and man is ever hasty
and we have made the night and day two signs and we erased the sign of the night and made the sign of the day visible that you may seek bounty from your lord and may know the number of years and the account of time and everything we have set out in detail
and for every person we have imposed his fate upon his neck and we will produce for him on the day of resurrection a record which he will encounter spread open
it will be said read your record sufficient is yourself against you this day as accountant
whoever is guided is only guided for the benefit of his soul and whoever errs only errs against it and no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another and never would we punish until we sent a messenger
and when we intend to destroy a city we command its affluent but they defiantly disobey therein so the word comes into effect upon it and we destroy it with complete destruction
and how many have we destroyed from the generations after noah and sufficient is your lord concerning the sins of his servants as acquainted and seeing
whoever should desire the immediate we hasten for him from it what we will to whom we intend then we have made for him hell which he will enter to burn censured and banished
but whoever desires the hereafter and exerts the effort due to it while he is a believer it is those whose effort is ever appreciated by allah
to each category we extend to these and to those from the gift of your lord and never has the gift of your lord been restricted
look how we have favored in provision some of them over others but the hereafter is greater in degrees of difference and greater in distinction
do not make as equal with allah another deity and thereby become censured and forsaken
and your lord has decreed that you not worship except him and to parents good treatment whether one or both of them reach old age while with you say not to them so much as uff and do not repel them but speak to them a noble word
and lower to them the wing of humility out of mercy and say my lord have mercy upon them as they brought me up when i was small
your lord is most knowing of what is within yourselves if you should be righteous in intention then indeed he is ever to the often returning to him forgiving
and give the relative his right and also the poor and the traveler and do not spend wastefully
indeed the wasteful are brothers of the devils and ever has satan been to his lord ungrateful
and if you must turn away from the needy awaiting mercy from your lord which you expect then speak to them a gentle word
and do not make your hand as chained to your neck or extend it completely and thereby become blamed and insolvent
indeed your lord extends provision for whom he wills and restricts it indeed he is ever concerning his servants acquainted and seeing
and do not kill your children for fear of poverty we provide for them and for you indeed their killing is ever a great sin
and do not approach unlawful sexual intercourse indeed it is ever an immorality and is evil as a way
and do not kill the soul which allah has forbidden except by right and whoever is killed unjustly we have given his heir authority but let him not exceed limits in the matter of taking life indeed he has been supported by the law
and do not approach the property of an orphan except in the way that is best until he reaches maturity and fulfill every commitment indeed the commitment is ever that about which one will be questioned
and give full measure when you measure and weigh with an even balance that is the best way and best in result
and do not pursue that of which you have no knowledge indeed the hearing the sight and the heart about all those one will be questioned
and do not walk upon the earth exultantly indeed you will never tear the earth apart and you will never reach the mountains in height
all that its evil is ever in the sight of your lord detested
that is from what your lord has revealed to you o muhammad of wisdom and o mankind do not make as equal with allah another deity lest you be thrown into hell blamed and banished
then has your lord chosen you for having sons and taken from among the angels daughters indeed you say a grave saying
and we have certainly diversified the contents in this qur an that mankind may be reminded but it does not increase the disbelievers except in aversion
say o muhammad if there had been with him other gods as they say then they each would have sought to the owner of the throne a way
exalted is he and high above what they say by great sublimity
the seven heavens and the earth and whatever is in them exalt him and there is not a thing except that it exalts allah by his praise but you do not understand their way of exalting indeed he is ever forbearing and forgiving
and when you recite the qur an we put between you and those who do not believe in the hereafter a concealed partition
and we have placed over their hearts coverings lest they understand it and in their ears deafness and when you mention your lord alone in the qur an they turn back in aversion
we are most knowing of how they listen to it when they listen to you and of when they are in private conversation when the wrongdoers say you follow not but a man affected by magic
look how they strike for you comparisons but they have strayed so they cannot find a way
and they say when we are bones and crumbled particles will we truly be resurrected as a new creation
say be you stones or iron
or any creation of that which is great within your breasts and they will say who will restore us say he who brought you forth the first time then they will nod their heads toward you and say when is that say perhaps it will be soon
on the day he will call you and you will respond with praise of him and think that you had not remained in the world except for a little
and tell my servants to say that which is best indeed satan induces dissension among them indeed satan is ever to mankind a clear enemy
your lord is most knowing of you if he wills he will have mercy upon you or if he wills he will punish you and we have not sent you o muhammad over them as a manager
and your lord is most knowing of whoever is in the heavens and the earth and we have made some of the prophets exceed others in various ways and to david we gave the book of psalms
say invoke those you have claimed as gods besides him for they do not possess the ability for removal of adversity from you or for its transfer to someone else
those whom they invoke seek means of access to their lord striving as to which of them would be nearest and they hope for his mercy and fear his punishment indeed the punishment of your lord is ever feared
and there is no city but that we will destroy it before the day of resurrection or punish it with a severe punishment that has ever been in the register inscribed
and nothing has prevented us from sending signs except that the former peoples denied them and we gave thamud the she camel as a visible sign but they wronged her and we send not the signs except as a warning
and remember o muhammad when we told you indeed your lord has encompassed the people and we did not make the sight which we showed you except as a trial for the people as was the accursed tree mentioned in the qur an and we threaten them but it increases them not except in great transgression
and mention when we said to the angles prostrate to adam and they prostrated except for iblees he said should i prostrate to one you created from clay
iblees said do you see this one whom you have honored above me if you delay me until the day of resurrection i will surely destroy his descendants except for a few
allah said go for whoever of them follows you indeed hell will be the recompense of you an ample recompense
and incite to senselessness whoever you can among them with your voice and assault them with your horses and foot soldiers and become a partner in their wealth and their children and promise them but satan does not promise them except delusion
indeed over my believing servants there is for you no authority and sufficient is your lord as disposer of affairs
it is your lord who drives the ship for you through the sea that you may seek of his bounty indeed he is ever to you merciful
and when adversity touches you at sea lost are all those you invoke except for him but when he delivers you to the land you turn away from him and ever is man ungrateful
then do you feel secure that instead he will not cause a part of the land to swallow you or send against you a storm of stones then you would not find for yourselves an advocate
or do you feel secure that he will not send you back into the sea another time and send upon you a hurricane of wind and drown you for what you denied then you would not find for yourselves against us an avenger
and we have certainly honored the children of adam and carried them on the land and sea and provided for them of the good things and preferred them over much of what we have created with definite preference
mention o muhammad the day we will call forth every people with their record of deeds then whoever is given his record in his right hand those will read their records and injustice will not be done to them even as much as a thread inside the date seed
and whoever is blind in this life will be blind in the hereafter and more astray in way
and indeed they were about to tempt you away from that which we revealed to you in order to make you invent about us something else and then they would have taken you as a friend
and if we had not strengthened you you would have almost inclined to them a little
then if you had we would have made you taste double punishment in life and double after death then you would not find for yourself against us a helper
and indeed they were about to drive you from the land to evict you therefrom and then when they do they will not remain there after you except for a little
that is our established way for those we had sent before you of our messengers and you will not find in our way any alteration
establish prayer at the decline of the sun from its meridian until the darkness of the night and also the qur an of dawn indeed the recitation of dawn is ever witnessed
and from part of the night pray with it as additional worship for you it is expected that your lord will resurrect you to a praised station
and say my lord cause me to enter a sound entrance and to exit a sound exit and grant me from yourself a supporting authority
and say truth has come and falsehood has departed indeed is falsehood by nature ever bound to depart
and we send down of the qur an that which is healing and mercy for the believers but it does not increase the wrongdoers except in loss
and when we bestow favor upon the disbeliever he turns away and distances himself and when evil touches him he is ever despairing
say each works according to his manner but your lord is most knowing of who is best guided in way
and they ask you o muhammad about the soul say the soul is of the affair of my lord and mankind have not been given of knowledge except a little
and if we willed we could surely do away with that which we revealed to you then you would not find for yourself concerning it an advocate against us
except we have left it with you as a mercy from your lord indeed his favor upon you has ever been great
say if mankind and the jinn gathered in order to produce the like of this qur an they could not produce the like of it even if they were to each other assistants
and we have certainly diversified for the people in this qur an from every kind of example but most of the people refused anything except disbelief
and they say we will not believe you until you break open for us from the ground a spring
or until you have a garden of palm tress and grapes and make rivers gush forth within them in force and abundance
or you make the heaven fall upon us in fragments as you have claimed or you bring allah and the angels before us
or you have a house of gold or you ascend into the sky and even then we will not believe in your ascension until you bring down to us a book we may read say exalted is my lord was i ever but a human messenger
and what prevented the people from believing when guidance came to them except that they said has allah sent a human messenger
say if there were upon the earth angels walking securely we would have sent down to them from the heaven an angel as a messenger
say sufficient is allah as witness between me and you indeed he is ever concerning his servants acquainted and seeing
and whoever allah guides he is the rightly guided and whoever he sends astray you will never find for them protectors besides him and we will gather them on the day of resurrection fallen on their faces blind dumb and deaf their refuge is hell every time it subsides we increase them in blazing fire
that is their recompense because they disbelieved in our verses and said when we are bones and crumbled particles will we truly be resurrected in a new creation
do they not see that allah who created the heavens and earth is the one able to create the likes of them and he has appointed for them a term about which there is no doubt but the wrongdoers refuse anything except disbelief
say to them if you possessed the depositories of the mercy of my lord then you would withhold out of fear of spending and ever has man been stingy
and we had certainly given moses nine evident signs so ask the children of israel about when he came to them and pharaoh said to him indeed i think o moses that you are affected by magic
moses said you have already known that none has sent down these signs except the lord of the heavens and the earth as evidence and indeed i think o pharaoh that you are destroyed
so he intended to drive them from the land but we drowned him and those with him all together
and we said after pharaoh to the children of israel dwell in the land and when there comes the promise of the hereafter we will bring you forth in one gathering
and with the truth we have sent the qur an down and with the truth it has descended and we have not sent you o muhammad except as a bringer of good tidings and a warner
and it is a qur an which we have separated by intervals that you might recite it to the people over a prolonged period and we have sent it down progressively
say believe in it or do not believe indeed those who were given knowledge before it when it is recited to them they fall upon their faces in prostration
and they say exalted is our lord indeed the promise of our lord has been fulfilled
and they fall upon their faces weeping and the qur an increases them in humble submission
say call upon allah or call upon the most merciful whichever name you call to him belong the best names and do not recite too loudly in your prayer or too quietly but seek between that an intermediate way
and say praise to allah who has not taken a son and has had no partner in his dominion and has no need of a protector out of weakness and glorify him with great glorification
all praise is due to allah who has sent down upon his servant the book and has not made therein any deviance
he has made it straight to warn of severe punishment from him and to give good tidings to the believers who do righteous deeds that they will have a good reward
in which they will remain forever
and to warn those who say allah has taken a son
they have no knowledge of it nor had their fathers grave is the word that comes out of their mouths they speak not except a lie
then perhaps you would kill yourself through grief over them o muhammad if they do not believe in this message and out of sorrow
indeed we have made that which is on the earth adornment for it that we may test them as to which of them is best in deed
and indeed we will make that which is upon it into a barren ground
or have you thought that the companions of the cave and the inscription were among our signs a wonder
mention when the youths retreated to the cave and said our lord grant us from yourself mercy and prepare for us from our affair right guidance
so we cast a cover of sleep over their ears within the cave for a number of years
then we awakened them that we might show which of the two factions was most precise in calculating what extent they had remained in time
it is we who relate to you o muhammad their story in truth indeed they were youths who believed in their lord and we increased them in guidance
and we made firm their hearts when they stood up and said our lord is the lord of the heavens and the earth never will we invoke besides him any deity we would have certainly spoken then an excessive transgression
these our people have taken besides him deities why do they not bring for worship of them a clear authority and who is more unjust than one who invents about allah a lie
the youths said to one another and when you have withdrawn from them and that which they worship other than allah retreat to the cave your lord will spread out for you of his mercy and will prepare for you from your affair facility
and had you been present you would see the sun when it rose inclining away from their cave on the right and when it set passing away from them on the left while they were laying within an open space thereof that was from the signs of allah he whom allah guides is the rightly guided but he whom he leaves astray never will you find for him a protecting guide
and you would think them awake while they were asleep and we turned them to the right and to the left while their dog stretched his forelegs at the entrance if you had looked at them you would have turned from them in flight and been filled by them with terror
and similarly we awakened them that they might question one another said a speaker from among them how long have you remained here they said we have remained a day or part of a day they said your lord is most knowing of how long you remained so send one of you with this silver coin of yours to the city and let him look to which is the best of food and bring you provision from it and let him be cautious and let no one be aware of you
indeed if they come to know of you they will stone you or return you to their religion and never would you succeed then ever
and similarly we caused them to be found that they who found them would know that the promise of allah is truth and that of the hour there is no doubt that was when they disputed among themselves about their affair and then said construct over them a structure their lord is most knowing about them said those who prevailed in the matter we will surely take for ourselves over them a masjid
they will say there were three the fourth of them being their dog and they will say there were five the sixth of them being their dog guessing at the unseen and they will say there were seven and the eighth of them was their dog say o muhammad my lord is most knowing of their number none knows them except a few so do not argue about them except with an obvious argument and do not inquire about them among the speculators from anyone
and never say of anything indeed i will do that tomorrow
except when adding if allah wills and remember your lord when you forget it and say perhaps my lord will guide me to what is nearer than this to right conduct
and they remained in their cave for three hundred years and exceeded by nine
say allah is most knowing of how long they remained he has knowledge of the unseen aspects of the heavens and the earth how seeing is he and how hearing they have not besides him any protector and he shares not his legislation with anyone
and recite o muhammad what has been revealed to you of the book of your lord there is no changer of his words and never will you find in other than him a refuge
and keep yourself patient by being with those who call upon their lord in the morning and the evening seeking his countenance and let not your eyes pass beyond them desiring adornments of the worldly life and do not obey one whose heart we have made heedless of our remembrance and who follows his desire and whose affair is ever in neglect
and say the truth is from your lord so whoever wills let him believe and whoever wills let him disbelieve indeed we have prepared for the wrongdoers a fire whose walls will surround them and if they call for relief they will be relieved with water like murky oil which scalds their faces wretched is the drink and evil is the resting place
indeed those who have believed and done righteous deeds indeed we will not allow to be lost the reward of any who did well in deeds
those will have gardens of perpetual residence beneath them rivers will flow they will be adorned therein with bracelets of gold and will wear green garments of fine silk and brocade reclining therein on adorned couches excellent is the reward and good is the resting place
and present to them an example of two men we granted to one of them two gardens of grapevines and we bordered them with palm trees and placed between them fields of crops
each of the two gardens produced its fruit and did not fall short thereof in anything and we caused to gush forth within them a river
and he had fruit so he said to his companion while he was conversing with him i am greater than you in wealth and mightier in numbers of men
and he entered his garden while he was unjust to himself he said i do not think that this will perish ever
and i do not think the hour will occur and even if i should be brought back to my lord i will surely find better than this as a return
his companion said to him while he was conversing with him have you disbelieved in he who created you from dust and then from a sperm drop and then proportioned you as a man
but as for me he is allah my lord and i do not associate with my lord anyone
and why did you when you entered your garden not say what allah willed has occurred there is no power except in allah although you see me less than you in wealth and children
it may be that my lord will give me something better than your garden and will send upon it a calamity from the sky and it will become a smooth dusty ground
or its water will become sunken into the earth so you would never be able to seek it
and his fruits were encompassed by ruin so he began to turn his hands about in dismay over what he had spent on it while it had collapsed upon its trellises and said oh i wish i had not associated with my lord anyone
and there was for him no company to aid him other than allah nor could he defend himself
there the authority is completely for allah the truth he is best in reward and best in outcome
and present to them the example of the life of this world its being like rain which we send down from the sky and the vegetation of the earth mingles with it and then it becomes dry remnants scattered by the winds and allah is ever over all things perfect in ability
wealth and children are but adornment of the worldly life but the enduring good deeds are better to your lord for reward and better for one s hope
and warn of the day when we will remove the mountains and you will see the earth prominent and we will gather them and not leave behind from them anyone
and they will be presented before your lord in rows and he will say you have certainly come to us just as we created you the first time but you claimed that we would never make for you an appointment
and the record of deeds will be placed open and you will see the criminals fearful of that within it and they will say oh woe to us what is this book that leaves nothing small or great except that it has enumerated it and they will find what they did present before them and your lord does injustice to no one
and mention when we said to the angels prostrate to adam and they prostrated except for iblees he was of the jinn and departed from the command of his lord then will you take him and his descendants as allies other than me while they are enemies to you wretched it is for the wrongdoers as an exchange
i did not make them witness to the creation of the heavens and the earth or to the creation of themselves and i would not have taken the misguiders as assistants
and warn of the day when he will say call my partners whom you claimed and they will invoke them but they will not respond to them and we will put between them a valley of destruction
and the criminals will see the fire and will be certain that they are to fall therein and they will not find from it a way elsewhere
and we have certainly diversified in this qur an for the people from every kind of example but man has ever been most of anything prone to dispute
and nothing has prevented the people from believing when guidance came to them and from asking forgiveness of their lord except that there must befall them the accustomed precedent of the former peoples or that the punishment should come directly before them
and we send not the messengers except as bringers of good tidings and warners and those who disbelieve dispute by using falsehood to attempt to invalidate thereby the truth and have taken my verses and that of which they are warned in ridicule
and who is more unjust than one who is reminded of the verses of his lord but turns away from them and forgets what his hands have put forth indeed we have placed over their hearts coverings lest they understand it and in their ears deafness and if you invite them to guidance they will never be guided then ever
and your lord is the forgiving full of mercy if he were to impose blame upon them for what they earned he would have hastened for them the punishment rather for them is an appointment from which they will never find an escape
and those cities we destroyed them when they wronged and we made for their destruction an appointed time
and mention when moses said to his servant i will not cease traveling until i reach the junction of the two seas or continue for a long period
but when they reached the junction between them they forgot their fish and it took its course into the sea slipping away
so when they had passed beyond it moses said to his boy bring us our morning meal we have certainly suffered in this our journey much fatigue
he said did you see when we retired to the rock indeed i forgot there the fish and none made me forget it except satan that i should mention it and it took its course into the sea amazingly
moses said that is what we were seeking so they returned following their footprints
and they found a servant from among our servants to whom we had given mercy from us and had taught him from us a certain knowledge
moses said to him may i follow you on the condition that you teach me from what you have been taught of sound judgement
he said indeed with me you will never be able to have patience
and how can you have patience for what you do not encompass in knowledge
moses said you will find me if allah wills patient and i will not disobey you in any order
he said then if you follow me do not ask me about anything until i make to you about it mention
so they set out until when they had embarked on the ship al khidh r tore it open moses said have you torn it open to drown its people you have certainly done a grave thing
al khidh r said did i not say that with me you would never be able to have patience
moses said do not blame me for what i forgot and do not cover me in my matter with difficulty
so they set out until when they met a boy al khidh r killed him moses said have you killed a pure soul for other than having killed a soul you have certainly done a deplorable thing
al khidh r said did i not tell you that with me you would never be able to have patience
moses said if i should ask you about anything after this then do not keep me as a companion you have obtained from me an excuse
so they set out until when they came to the people of a town they asked its people for food but they refused to offer them hospitality and they found therein a wall about to collapse so al khidh r restored it moses said if you wished you could have taken for it a payment
al khidh r said this is parting between me and you i will inform you of the interpretation of that about which you could not have patience
as for the ship it belonged to poor people working at sea so i intended to cause defect in it as there was after them a king who seized every good ship by force
and as for the boy his parents were believers and we feared that he would overburden them by transgression and disbelief
so we intended that their lord should substitute for them one better than him in purity and nearer to mercy
and as for the wall it belonged to two orphan boys in the city and there was beneath it a treasure for them and their father had been righteous so your lord intended that they reach maturity and extract their treasure as a mercy from your lord and i did it not of my own accord that is the interpretation of that about which you could not have patience
and they ask you o muhammad about dhul qarnayn say i will recite to you about him a report
indeed we established him upon the earth and we gave him to everything a way
so he followed a way
until when he reached the setting of the sun he found it as if setting in a spring of dark mud and he found near it a people allah said o dhul qarnayn either you punish them or else adopt among them a way of goodness
he said as for one who wrongs we will punish him then he will be returned to his lord and he will punish him with a terrible punishment
but as for one who believes and does righteousness he will have a reward of paradise and we will speak to him from our command with ease
then he followed a way
until when he came to the rising of the sun he found it rising on a people for whom we had not made against it any shield
thus and we had encompassed all that he had in knowledge
then he followed a way
until when he reached a pass between two mountains he found beside them a people who could hardly understand his speech
they said o dhul qarnayn indeed gog and magog are great corrupters in the land so may we assign for you an expenditure that you might make between us and them a barrier
he said that in which my lord has established me is better than what you offer but assist me with strength i will make between you and them a dam
bring me sheets of iron until when he had leveled them between the two mountain walls he said blow with bellows until when he had made it like fire he said bring me that i may pour over it molten copper
so gog and magog were unable to pass over it nor were they able to effect in it any penetration
dhul qarnayn said this is a mercy from my lord but when the promise of my lord comes he will make it level and ever is the promise of my lord true
and we will leave them that day surging over each other and then the horn will be blown and we will assemble them in one assembly
and we will present hell that day to the disbelievers on display
those whose eyes had been within a cover removed from my remembrance and they were not able to hear
then do those who disbelieve think that they can take my servants instead of me as allies indeed we have prepared hell for the disbelievers as a lodging
say o muhammad shall we believers inform you of the greatest losers as to their deeds
they are those whose effort is lost in worldly life while they think that they are doing well in work
those are the ones who disbelieve in the verses of their lord and in their meeting him so their deeds have become worthless and we will not assign to them on the day of resurrection any importance
that is their recompense hell for what they denied and because they took my signs and my messengers in ridicule
indeed those who have believed and done righteous deeds they will have the gardens of paradise as a lodging
wherein they abide eternally they will not desire from it any transfer
say if the sea were ink for writing the words of my lord the sea would be exhausted before the words of my lord were exhausted even if we brought the like of it as a supplement
say i am only a man like you to whom has been revealed that your god is one god so whoever would hope for the meeting with his lord let him do righteous work and not associate in the worship of his lord anyone
kaf ha ya ayn sad
this is a mention of the mercy of your lord to his servant zechariah
when he called to his lord a private supplication
he said my lord indeed my bones have weakened and my head has filled with white and never have i been in my supplication to you my lord unhappy
and indeed i fear the successors after me and my wife has been barren so give me from yourself an heir
who will inherit me and inherit from the family of jacob and make him my lord pleasing to you
he was told o zechariah indeed we give you good tidings of a boy whose name will be john we have not assigned to any before this name
he said my lord how will i have a boy when my wife has been barren and i have reached extreme old age
an angel said thus it will be your lord says it is easy for me for i created you before while you were nothing
zechariah said my lord make for me a sign he said your sign is that you will not speak to the people for three nights being sound
so he came out to his people from the prayer chamber and signaled to them to exalt allah in the morning and afternoon
allah said o john take the scripture with determination and we gave him judgement while yet a boy
and affection from us and purity and he was fearing of allah
and dutiful to his parents and he was not a disobedient tyrant
and peace be upon him the day he was born and the day he dies and the day he is raised alive
and mention o muhammad in the book the story of mary when she withdrew from her family to a place toward the east
and she took in seclusion from them a screen then we sent to her our angel and he represented himself to her as a well proportioned man
she said indeed i seek refuge in the most merciful from you so leave me if you should be fearing of allah
he said i am only the messenger of your lord to give you news of a pure boy
she said how can i have a boy while no man has touched me and i have not been unchaste
he said thus it will be your lord says it is easy for me and we will make him a sign to the people and a mercy from us and it is a matter already decreed
so she conceived him and she withdrew with him to a remote place
and the pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a palm tree she said oh i wish i had died before this and was in oblivion forgotten
but he called her from below her do not grieve your lord has provided beneath you a stream
and shake toward you the trunk of the palm tree it will drop upon you ripe fresh dates
so eat and drink and be contented and if you see from among humanity anyone say indeed i have vowed to the most merciful abstention so i will not speak today to any man
then she brought him to her people carrying him they said o mary you have certainly done a thing unprecedented
o sister of aaron your father was not a man of evil nor was your mother unchaste
so she pointed to him they said how can we speak to one who is in the cradle a child
jesus said indeed i am the servant of allah he has given me the scripture and made me a prophet
and he has made me blessed wherever i am and has enjoined upon me prayer and zakah as long as i remain alive
and made me dutiful to my mother and he has not made me a wretched tyrant
and peace is on me the day i was born and the day i will die and the day i am raised alive
that is jesus the son of mary the word of truth about which they are in dispute
it is not befitting for allah to take a son exalted is he when he decrees an affair he only says to it be and it is
jesus said and indeed allah is my lord and your lord so worship him that is a straight path
then the factions differed concerning jesus from among them so woe to those who disbelieved from the scene of a tremendous day
how clearly they will hear and see the day they come to us but the wrongdoers today are in clear error
and warn them o muhammad of the day of regret when the matter will be concluded and yet they are in a state of heedlessness and they do not believe
indeed it is we who will inherit the earth and whoever is on it and to us they will be returned
and mention in the book the story of abraham indeed he was a man of truth and a prophet
mention when he said to his father o my father why do you worship that which does not hear and does not see and will not benefit you at all
o my father indeed there has come to me of knowledge that which has not come to you so follow me i will guide you to an even path
o my father do not worship satan indeed satan has ever been to the most merciful disobedient
o my father indeed i fear that there will touch you a punishment from the most merciful so you would be to satan a companion in hellfire
his father said have you no desire for my gods o abraham if you do not desist i will surely stone you so avoid me a prolonged time
abraham said peace will be upon you i will ask forgiveness for you of my lord indeed he is ever gracious to me
and i will leave you and those you invoke other than allah and will invoke my lord i expect that i will not be in invocation to my lord unhappy
so when he had left them and those they worshipped other than allah we gave him isaac and jacob and each of them we made a prophet
and we gave them of our mercy and we made for them a reputation of high honor
and mention in the book moses indeed he was chosen and he was a messenger and a prophet
and we called him from the side of the mount at his right and brought him near confiding to him
and we gave him out of our mercy his brother aaron as a prophet
and mention in the book ishmael indeed he was true to his promise and he was a messenger and a prophet
and he used to enjoin on his people prayer and zakah and was to his lord pleasing
and mention in the book idrees indeed he was a man of truth and a prophet
and we raised him to a high station
those were the ones upon whom allah bestowed favor from among the prophets of the descendants of adam and of those we carried in the ship with noah and of the descendants of abraham and israel and of those whom we guided and chose when the verses of the most merciful were recited to them they fell in prostration and weeping
but there came after them successors who neglected prayer and pursued desires so they are going to meet evil
except those who repent believe and do righteousness for those will enter paradise and will not be wronged at all
therein are gardens of perpetual residence which the most merciful has promised his servants in the unseen indeed his promise has ever been coming
they will not hear therein any ill speech only greetings of peace and they will have their provision therein morning and afternoon
that is paradise which we give as inheritance to those of our servants who were fearing of allah
gabriel said and we angels descend not except by the order of your lord to him belongs that before us and that behind us and what is in between and never is your lord forgetful
lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them so worship him and have patience for his worship do you know of any similarity to him
and the disbeliever says when i have died am i going to be brought forth alive
does man not remember that we created him before while he was nothing
so by your lord we will surely gather them and the devils then we will bring them to be present around hell upon their knees
then we will surely extract from every sect those of them who were worst against the most merciful in insolence
then surely it is we who are most knowing of those most worthy of burning therein
and there is none of you except he will come to it this is upon your lord an inevitability decreed
then we will save those who feared allah and leave the wrongdoers within it on their knees
and when our verses are recited to them as clear evidences those who disbelieve say to those who believe which of our two parties is best in position and best in association
and how many a generation have we destroyed before them who were better in possessions and outward appearance
say whoever is in error let the most merciful extend for him an extension in wealth and time until when they see that which they were promised either punishment in this world or the hour of resurrection they will come to know who is worst in position and weaker in soldiers
and allah increases those who were guided in guidance and the enduring good deeds are better to your lord for reward and better for recourse
then have you seen he who disbelieved in our verses and said i will surely be given wealth and children in the next life
has he looked into the unseen or has he taken from the most merciful a promise
no we will record what he says and extend for him from the punishment extensively
and we will inherit him in what he mentions and he will come to us alone
and they have taken besides allah false deities that they would be for them a source of honor
no those gods will deny their worship of them and will be against them opponents on the day of judgement
do you not see that we have sent the devils upon the disbelievers inciting them to evil with constant incitement
so be not impatient over them we only count out to them a limited number
on the day we will gather the righteous to the most merciful as a delegation
and will drive the criminals to hell in thirst
none will have power of intercession except he who had taken from the most merciful a covenant
and they say the most merciful has taken for himself a son
you have done an atrocious thing
the heavens almost rupture therefrom and the earth splits open and the mountains collapse in devastation
that they attribute to the most merciful a son
and it is not appropriate for the most merciful that he should take a son
there is no one in the heavens and earth but that he comes to the most merciful as a servant
he has enumerated them and counted them a full counting
and all of them are coming to him on the day of resurrection alone
indeed those who have believed and done righteous deeds the most merciful will appoint for them affection
so o muhammad we have only made qur an easy in the arabic language that you may give good tidings thereby to the righteous and warn thereby a hostile people
and how many have we destroyed before them of generations do you perceive of them anyone or hear from them a sound
ta ha
we have not sent down to you the qur an that you be distressed
but only as a reminder for those who fear allah
a revelation from he who created the earth and highest heavens
the most merciful who is above the throne established
to him belongs what is in the heavens and what is on the earth and what is between them and what is under the soil
and if you speak aloud then indeed he knows the secret and what is even more hidden
allah there is no deity except him to him belong the best names
and has the story of moses reached you
when he saw a fire and said to his family stay here indeed i have perceived a fire perhaps i can bring you a torch or find at the fire some guidance
and when he came to it he was called o moses
indeed i am your lord so remove your sandals indeed you are in the sacred valley of tuwa
and i have chosen you so listen to what is revealed to you
indeed i am allah there is no deity except me so worship me and establish prayer for my remembrance
indeed the hour is coming i almost conceal it so that every soul may be recompensed according to that for which it strives
so do not let one avert you from it who does not believe in it and follows his desire for you then would perish
and what is that in your right hand o moses
he said it is my staff i lean upon it and i bring down leaves for my sheep and i have therein other uses
allah said throw it down o moses
so he threw it down and thereupon it was a snake moving swiftly
allah said seize it and fear not we will return it to its former condition
and draw in your hand to your side it will come out white without disease another sign
that we may show you some of our greater signs
go to pharaoh indeed he has transgressed
moses said my lord expand for me my breast with assurance
and ease for me my task
and untie the knot from my tongue
that they may understand my speech
and appoint for me a minister from my family
aaron my brother
increase through him my strength
and let him share my task
that we may exalt you much
and remember you much
indeed you are of us ever seeing
allah said you have been granted your request o moses
and we had already conferred favor upon you another time
when we inspired to your mother what we inspired
saying cast him into the chest and cast it into the river and the river will throw it onto the bank there will take him an enemy to me and an enemy to him and i bestowed upon you love from me that you would be brought up under my eye
and we favored you when your sister went and said shall i direct you to someone who will be responsible for him so we restored you to your mother that she might be content and not grieve and you killed someone but we saved you from retaliation and tried you with a severe trial and you remained some years among the people of madyan then you came here at the decreed time o moses
and i produced you for myself
go you and your brother with my signs and do not slacken in my remembrance
go both of you to pharaoh indeed he has transgressed
and speak to him with gentle speech that perhaps he may be reminded or fear allah
they said our lord indeed we are afraid that he will hasten punishment against us or that he will transgress
allah said fear not indeed i am with you both i hear and i see
so go to him and say indeed we are messengers of your lord so send with us the children of israel and do not torment them we have come to you with a sign from your lord and peace will be upon he who follows the guidance
indeed it has been revealed to us that the punishment will be upon whoever denies and turns away
pharaoh said so who is the lord of you two o moses
he said our lord is he who gave each thing its form and then guided it
pharaoh said then what is the case of the former generations
moses said the knowledge thereof is with my lord in a record my lord neither errs nor forgets
it is he who has made for you the earth as a bed spread out and inserted therein for you roadways and sent down from the sky rain and produced thereby categories of various plants
eat therefrom and pasture your livestock indeed in that are signs for those of intelligence
from the earth we created you and into it we will return you and from it we will extract you another time
and we certainly showed pharaoh our signs all of them but he denied and refused
he said have you come to us to drive us out of our land with your magic o moses
then we will surely bring you magic like it so make between us and you an appointment which we will not fail to keep and neither will you in a place assigned
moses said your appointment is on the day of the festival when the people assemble at mid morning
so pharaoh went away put together his plan and then came to moses
moses said to the magicians summoned by pharaoh woe to you do not invent a lie against allah or he will exterminate you with a punishment and he has failed who invents such falsehood
so they disputed over their affair among themselves and concealed their private conversation
they said indeed these are two magicians who want to drive you out of your land with their magic and do away with your most exemplary way
so resolve upon your plan and then come forward in line and he has succeeded today who overcomes
they said o moses either you throw or we will be the first to throw
he said rather you throw and suddenly their ropes and staffs seemed to him from their magic that they were moving like snakes
and he sensed within himself apprehension did moses
allah said fear not indeed it is you who are superior
and throw what is in your right hand it will swallow up what they have crafted what they have crafted is but the trick of a magician and the magician will not succeed wherever he is
so the magicians fell down in prostration they said we have believed in the lord of aaron and moses
pharaoh said you believed him before i gave you permission indeed he is your leader who has taught you magic so i will surely cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides and i will crucify you on the trunks of palm trees and you will surely know which of us is more severe in giving punishment and more enduring
they said never will we prefer you over what has come to us of clear proofs and over he who created us so decree whatever you are to decree you can only decree for this worldly life
indeed we have believed in our lord that he may forgive us our sins and what you compelled us to do of magic and allah is better and more enduring
indeed whoever comes to his lord as a criminal indeed for him is hell he will neither die therein nor live
but whoever comes to him as a believer having done righteous deeds for those will be the highest degrees in position
gardens of perpetual residence beneath which rivers flow wherein they abide eternally and that is the reward of one who purifies himself
and we had inspired to moses travel by night with my servants and strike for them a dry path through the sea you will not fear being overtaken by pharaoh nor be afraid of drowning
so pharaoh pursued them with his soldiers and there covered them from the sea that which covered them
and pharaoh led his people astray and did not guide them
o children of israel we delivered you from your enemy and we made an appointment with you at the right side of the mount and we sent down to you manna and quails
saying eat from the good things with which we have provided you and do not transgress or oppress others therein lest my anger should descend upon you and he upon whom my anger descends has certainly fallen
but indeed i am the perpetual forgiver of whoever repents and believes and does righteousness and then continues in guidance
allah said and what made you hasten from your people o moses
he said they are close upon my tracks and i hastened to you my lord that you be pleased
allah said but indeed we have tried your people after you departed and the samiri has led them astray
so moses returned to his people angry and grieved he said o my people did your lord not make you a good promise then was the time of its fulfillment too long for you or did you wish that wrath from your lord descend upon you so you broke your promise of obedience to me
they said we did not break our promise to you by our will but we were made to carry burdens from the ornaments of the people of pharaoh so we threw them into the fire and thus did the samiri throw
and he extracted for them the statue of a calf which had a lowing sound and they said this is your god and the god of moses but he forgot
did they not see that it could not return to them any speech and that it did not possess for them any harm or benefit
and aaron had already told them before the return of moses o my people you are only being tested by it and indeed your lord is the most merciful so follow me and obey my order
they said we will never cease being devoted to the calf until moses returns to us
moses said o aaron what prevented you when you saw them going astray
from following me then have you disobeyed my order
aaron said o son of my mother do not seize me by my beard or by my head indeed i feared that you would say you caused division among the children of israel and you did not observe or await my word
moses said and what is your case o samiri
he said i saw what they did not see so i took a handful of dust from the track of the messenger and threw it and thus did my soul entice me
moses said then go and indeed it is decreed for you in this life to say no contact and indeed you have an appointment in the hereafter you will not fail to keep and look at your god to which you remained devoted we will surely burn it and blow it into the sea with a blast
your god is only allah except for whom there is no deity he has encompassed all things in knowledge
thus o muhammad we relate to you from the news of what has preceded and we have certainly given you from us the qur an
whoever turns away from it then indeed he will bear on the day of resurrection a burden
abiding eternally therein and evil it is for them on the day of resurrection as a load
the day the horn will be blown and we will gather the criminals that day blue eyed
they will murmur among themselves you remained not but ten days in the world
we are most knowing of what they say when the best of them in manner will say you remained not but one day
and they ask you about the mountains so say my lord will blow them away with a blast
and he will leave the earth a level plain
you will not see therein a depression or an elevation
that day everyone will follow the call of the caller with no deviation therefrom and all voices will be stilled before the most merciful so you will not hear except a whisper of footsteps
that day no intercession will benefit except that of one to whom the most merciful has given permission and has accepted his word
allah knows what is presently before them and what will be after them but they do not encompass it in knowledge
and all faces will be humbled before the ever living the sustainer of existence and he will have failed who carries injustice
but he who does of righteous deeds while he is a believer he will neither fear injustice nor deprivation
and thus we have sent it down as an arabic qur an and have diversified therein the warnings that perhaps they will avoid sin or it would cause them remembrance
so high above all is allah the sovereign the truth and o muhammad do not hasten with recitation of the qur an before its revelation is completed to you and say my lord increase me in knowledge
and we had already taken a promise from adam before but he forgot and we found not in him determination
and mention when we said to the angels prostrate to adam and they prostrated except iblees he refused
so we said o adam indeed this is an enemy to you and to your wife then let him not remove you from paradise so you would suffer
indeed it is promised for you not to be hungry therein or be unclothed
and indeed you will not be thirsty therein or be hot from the sun
then satan whispered to him he said o adam shall i direct you to the tree of eternity and possession that will not deteriorate
and adam and his wife ate of it and their private parts became apparent to them and they began to fasten over themselves from the leaves of paradise and adam disobeyed his lord and erred
then his lord chose him and turned to him in forgiveness and guided him
allah said descend from paradise all your descendants being enemies to one another and if there should come to you guidance from me then whoever follows my guidance will neither go astray in the world nor suffer in the hereafter
and whoever turns away from my remembrance indeed he will have a depressed life and we will gather him on the day of resurrection blind
he will say my lord why have you raised me blind while i was once seeing
allah will say thus did our signs come to you and you forgot them and thus will you this day be forgotten
and thus do we recompense he who transgressed and did not believe in the signs of his lord and the punishment of the hereafter is more severe and more enduring
then has it not become clear to them how many generations we destroyed before them as they walk among their dwellings indeed in that are signs for those of intelligence
and if not for a word that preceded from your lord punishment would have been an obligation due immediately and if not for a specified term decreed
so be patient over what they say and exalt allah with praise of your lord before the rising of the sun and before its setting and during periods of the night exalt him and at the ends of the day that you may be satisfied
and do not extend your eyes toward that by which we have given enjoyment to some categories of them its being but the splendor of worldly life by which we test them and the provision of your lord is better and more enduring
and enjoin prayer upon your family and people and be steadfast therein we ask you not for provision we provide for you and the best outcome is for those of righteousness
and they say why does he not bring us a sign from his lord has there not come to them evidence of what was in the former scriptures
and if we had destroyed them with a punishment before him they would have said our lord why did you not send to us a messenger so we could have followed your verses before we were humiliated and disgraced
say each of us is waiting so wait for you will know who are the companions of the sound path and who is guided
the time of their account has approached for the people while they are in heedlessness turning away
no mention comes to them anew from their lord except that they listen to it while they are at play
with their hearts distracted and those who do wrong conceal their private conversation saying is this prophet except a human being like you so would you approach magic while you are aware of it
the prophet said my lord knows whatever is said throughout the heaven and earth and he is the hearing the knowing
but they say the revelation is but a mixture of false dreams rather he has invented it rather he is a poet so let him bring us a sign just as the previous messengers were sent with miracles
not a single city which we destroyed believed before them so will they believe
and we sent not before you o muhammad except men to whom we revealed the message so ask the people of the message if you do not know
and we did not make the prophets forms not eating food nor were they immortal on earth
then we fulfilled for them the promise and we saved them and whom we willed and destroyed the transgressors
we have certainly sent down to you a book in which is your mention then will you not reason
and how many a city which was unjust have we shattered and produced after it another people
and when its inhabitants perceived our punishment at once they fled from it
some angels said do not flee but return to where you were given luxury and to your homes perhaps you will be questioned
they said o woe to us indeed we were wrongdoers
and that declaration of theirs did not cease until we made them as a harvest mowed down extinguished like a fire
and we did not create the heaven and earth and that between them in play
had we intended to take a diversion we could have taken it from what is with us if indeed we were to do so
rather we dash the truth upon falsehood and it destroys it and thereupon it departs and for you is destruction from that which you describe
to him belongs whoever is in the heavens and the earth and those near him are not prevented by arrogance from his worship nor do they tire
they exalt him night and day and do not slacken
or have men taken for themselves gods from the earth who resurrect the dead
had there been within the heavens and earth gods besides allah they both would have been ruined so exalted is allah lord of the throne above what they describe
he is not questioned about what he does but they will be questioned
or have they taken gods besides him say o muhammad produce your proof this qur an is the message for those with me and the message of those before me but most of them do not know the truth so they are turning away
and we sent not before you any messenger except that we revealed to him that there is no deity except me so worship me
and they say the most merciful has taken a son exalted is he rather they are but honored servants
they cannot precede him in word and they act by his command
he knows what is presently before them and what will be after them and they cannot intercede except on behalf of one whom he approves and they from fear of him are apprehensive
and whoever of them should say indeed i am a god besides him that one we would recompense with hell thus do we recompense the wrongdoers
have those who disbelieved not considered that the heavens and the earth were a joined entity and we separated them and made from water every living thing then will they not believe
and we placed within the earth firmly set mountains lest it should shift with them and we made therein mountain passes as roads that they might be guided
and we made the sky a protected ceiling but they from its signs are turning away
and it is he who created the night and the day and the sun and the moon all heavenly bodies in an orbit are swimming
and we did not grant to any man before you eternity on earth so if you die would they be eternal
every soul will taste death and we test you with evil and with good as trial and to us you will be returned
and when those who disbelieve see you o muhammad they take you not except in ridicule saying is this the one who insults your gods and they are at the mention of the most merciful disbelievers
man was created of haste i will show you my signs so do not impatiently urge me
and they say when is this promise if you should be truthful
if those who disbelieved but knew the time when they will not avert the fire from their faces or from their backs and they will not be aided
rather it will come to them unexpectedly and bewilder them and they will not be able to repel it nor will they be reprieved
and already were messengers ridiculed before you but those who mocked them were enveloped by what they used to ridicule
say who can protect you at night or by day from the most merciful but they are from the remembrance of their lord turning away
or do they have gods to defend them other than us they are unable even to help themselves nor can they be protected from us
but on the contrary we have provided good things for these disbelievers and their fathers until life was prolonged for them then do they not see that we set upon the land reducing it from its borders so it is they who will overcome
say i only warn you by revelation but the deaf do not hear the call when they are warned
and if as much as a whiff of the punishment of your lord should touch them they would surely say o woe to us indeed we have been wrongdoers
and we place the scales of justice for the day of resurrection so no soul will be treated unjustly at all and if there is even the weight of a mustard seed we will bring it forth and sufficient are we as accountant
and we had already given moses and aaron the criterion and a light and a reminder for the righteous
who fear their lord unseen while they are of the hour apprehensive
and this qur an is a blessed message which we have sent down then are you with it unacquainted
and we had certainly given abraham his sound judgement before and we were of him well knowing
when he said to his father and his people what are these statues to which you are devoted
they said we found our fathers worshippers of them
he said you were certainly you and your fathers in manifest error
they said have you come to us with truth or are you of those who jest
he said no rather your lord is the lord of the heavens and the earth who created them and i to that am of those who testify
and i swear by allah i will surely plan against your idols after you have turned and gone away
so he made them into fragments except a large one among them that they might return to it and question
they said who has done this to our gods indeed he is of the wrongdoers
they said we heard a young man mention them who is called abraham
they said then bring him before the eyes of the people that they may testify
they said have you done this to our gods o abraham
he said rather this the largest of them did it so ask them if they should be able to speak
so they returned to blaming themselves and said to each other indeed you are the wrongdoers
then they reversed themselves saying you have already known that these do not speak
he said then do you worship instead of allah that which does not benefit you at all or harm you
uff to you and to what you worship instead of allah then will you not use reason
they said burn him and support your gods if you are to act
allah said o fire be coolness and safety upon abraham
and they intended for him harm but we made them the greatest losers
and we delivered him and lot to the land which we had blessed for the worlds
and we gave him isaac and jacob in addition and all of them we made righteous
and we made them leaders guiding by our command and we inspired to them the doing of good deeds establishment of prayer and giving of zakah and they were worshippers of us
and to lot we gave judgement and knowledge and we saved him from the city that was committing wicked deeds indeed they were a people of evil defiantly disobedient
and we admitted him into our mercy indeed he was of the righteous
and mention noah when he called to allah before that time so we responded to him and saved him and his family from the great flood
and we saved him from the people who denied our signs indeed they were a people of evil so we drowned them all together
and mention david and solomon when they judged concerning the field when the sheep of a people overran it at night and we were witness to their judgement
and we gave understanding of the case to solomon and to each of them we gave judgement and knowledge and we subjected the mountains to exalt us along with david and also the birds and we were doing that
and we taught him the fashioning of coats of armor to protect you from your enemy in battle so will you then be grateful
and to solomon we subjected the wind blowing forcefully proceeding by his command toward the land which we had blessed and we are ever of all things knowing
and of the devils were those who dived for him and did work other than that and we were of them a guardian
and mention job when he called to his lord indeed adversity has touched me and you are the most merciful of the merciful
so we responded to him and removed what afflicted him of adversity and we gave him back his family and the like thereof with them as mercy from us and a reminder for the worshippers of allah
and mention ishmael and idrees and dhul kifl all were of the patient
and we admitted them into our mercy indeed they were of the righteous
and mention the man of the fish when he went off in anger and thought that we would not decree anything upon him and he called out within the darknesses there is no deity except you exalted are you indeed i have been of the wrongdoers
so we responded to him and saved him from the distress and thus do we save the believers
and mention zechariah when he called to his lord my lord do not leave me alone with no heir while you are the best of inheritors
so we responded to him and we gave to him john and amended for him his wife indeed they used to hasten to good deeds and supplicate us in hope and fear and they were to us humbly submissive
and mention the one who guarded her chastity so we blew into her garment through our angel gabriel and we made her and her son a sign for the worlds
indeed this your religion is one religion and i am your lord so worship me
and yet they divided their affair among themselves but all to us will return
so whoever does righteous deeds while he is a believer no denial will there be for his effort and indeed we of it are recorders
and there is prohibition upon the people of a city which we have destroyed that they will ever return
until when the dam of gog and magog has been opened and they from every elevation descend
and when the true promise has approached then suddenly the eyes of those who disbelieved will be staring in horror while they say o woe to us we had been unmindful of this rather we were wrongdoers
indeed you disbelievers and what you worship other than allah are the firewood of hell you will be coming to enter it
had these false deities been actual gods they would not have come to it but all are eternal therein
for them therein is heavy sighing and they therein will not hear
indeed those for whom the best reward has preceded from us they are from it far removed
they will not hear its sound while they are in that which their souls desire abiding eternally
they will not be grieved by the greatest terror and the angels will meet them saying this is your day which you have been promised
the day when we will fold the heaven like the folding of a written sheet for the records as we began the first creation we will repeat it that is a promise binding upon us indeed we will do it
and we have already written in the book of psalms after the previous mention that the land of paradise is inherited by my righteous servants
indeed in this qur an is notification for a worshipping people
and we have not sent you o muhammad except as a mercy to the worlds
say it is only revealed to me that your god is but one god so will you be muslims in submission to him
but if they turn away then say i have announced to all of you equally and i know not whether near or far is that which you are promised
indeed he knows what is declared of speech and he knows what you conceal
and i know not perhaps it is a trial for you and enjoyment for a time
the prophet has said my lord judge between us in truth and our lord is the most merciful the one whose help is sought against that which you describe
o mankind fear your lord indeed the convulsion of the final hour is a terrible thing
on the day you see it every nursing mother will be distracted from that child she was nursing and every pregnant woman will abort her pregnancy and you will see the people appearing intoxicated while they are not intoxicated but the punishment of allah is severe
and of the people is he who disputes about allah without knowledge and follows every rebellious devil
it has been decreed for every devil that whoever turns to him he will misguide him and will lead him to the punishment of the blaze
o people if you should be in doubt about the resurrection then consider that indeed we created you from dust then from a sperm drop then from a clinging clot and then from a lump of flesh formed and unformed that we may show you and we settle in the wombs whom we will for a specified term then we bring you out as a child and then we develop you that you may reach your time of maturity and among you is he who is taken in early death and among you is he who is returned to the most decrepit old age so that he knows after once having knowledge nothing and you see the earth barren but when we send down upon it rain it quivers and swells and grows something of every beautiful kind
that is because allah is the truth and because he gives life to the dead and because he is over all things competent
and that they may know that the hour is coming no doubt about it and that allah will resurrect those in the graves
and of the people is he who disputes about allah without knowledge or guidance or an enlightening book from him
twisting his neck in arrogance to mislead people from the way of allah for him in the world is disgrace and we will make him taste on the day of resurrection the punishment of the burning fire while it is said
that is for what your hands have put forth and because allah is not ever unjust to his servants
and of the people is he who worships allah on an edge if he is touched by good he is reassured by it but if he is struck by trial he turns on his face to the other direction he has lost this world and the hereafter that is what is the manifest loss
he invokes instead of allah that which neither harms him nor benefits him that is what is the extreme error
he invokes one whose harm is closer than his benefit how wretched the protector and how wretched the associate
indeed allah will admit those who believe and do righteous deeds to gardens beneath which rivers flow indeed allah does what he intends
whoever should think that allah will not support prophet muhammad in this world and the hereafter let him extend a rope to the ceiling then cut off his breath and let him see will his effort remove that which enrages him
and thus have we sent the qur an down as verses of clear evidence and because allah guides whom he intends
indeed those who have believed and those who were jews and the sabeans and the christians and the magians and those who associated with allah allah will judge between them on the day of resurrection indeed allah is over all things witness
do you not see that to allah prostrates whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth and the sun the moon the stars the mountains the trees the moving creatures and many of the people but upon many the punishment has been justified and he whom allah humiliates for him there is no bestower of honor indeed allah does what he wills
these are two adversaries who have disputed over their lord but those who disbelieved will have cut out for them garments of fire poured upon their heads will be scalding water
by which is melted that within their bellies and their skins
and for striking them are maces of iron
every time they want to get out of hellfire from anguish they will be returned to it and it will be said taste the punishment of the burning fire
indeed allah will admit those who believe and do righteous deeds to gardens beneath which rivers flow they will be adorned therein with bracelets of gold and pearl and their garments therein will be silk
and they had been guided in worldly life to good speech and they were guided to the path of the praiseworthy
indeed those who have disbelieved and avert people from the way of allah and from al masjid al haram which we made for the people equal are the resident therein and one from outside and also whoever intends a deed therein of deviation in religion or wrongdoing we will make him taste of a painful punishment
and mention o muhammad when we designated for abraham the site of the house saying do not associate anything with me and purify my house for those who perform tawaf and those who stand in prayer and those who bow and prostrate
and proclaim to the people the hajj pilgrimage they will come to you on foot and on every lean camel they will come from every distant pass
that they may witness benefits for themselves and mention the name of allah on known days over what he has provided for them of sacrificial animals so eat of them and feed the miserable and poor
then let them end their untidiness and fulfill their vows and perform tawaf around the ancient house
that has been commanded and whoever honors the sacred ordinances of allah it is best for him in the sight of his lord and permitted to you are the grazing livestock except what is recited to you so avoid the uncleanliness of idols and avoid false statement
inclining only to allah not associating anything with him and he who associates with allah it is as though he had fallen from the sky and was snatched by the birds or the wind carried him down into a remote place
that is so and whoever honors the symbols of allah indeed it is from the piety of hearts
for you the animals marked for sacrifice are benefits for a specified term then their place of sacrifice is at the ancient house
and for all religion we have appointed a rite of sacrifice that they may mention the name of allah over what he has provided for them of sacrificial animals for your god is one god so to him submit and o muhammad give good tidings to the humble before their lord
who when allah is mentioned their hearts are fearful and to the patient over what has afflicted them and the establishers of prayer and those who spend from what we have provided them
and the camels and cattle we have appointed for you as among the symbols of allah for you therein is good so mention the name of allah upon them when lined up for sacrifice and when they are lifeless on their sides then eat from them and feed the needy and the beggar thus have we subjected them to you that you may be grateful
their meat will not reach allah nor will their blood but what reaches him is piety from you thus have we subjected them to you that you may glorify allah for that to which he has guided you and give good tidings to the doers of good
indeed allah defends those who have believed indeed allah does not like everyone treacherous and ungrateful
permission to fight has been given to those who are being fought because they were wronged and indeed allah is competent to give them victory
they are those who have been evicted from their homes without right only because they say our lord is allah and were it not that allah checks the people some by means of others there would have been demolished monasteries churches synagogues and mosques in which the name of allah is much mentioned and allah will surely support those who support him indeed allah is powerful and exalted in might
and they are those who if we give them authority in the land establish prayer and give zakah and enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and to allah belongs the outcome of all matters
and if they deny you o muhammad so before them did the people of noah and aad and thamud deny their prophets
and the people of abraham and the people of lot
and the inhabitants of madyan and moses was denied so i prolonged enjoyment for the disbelievers then i seized them and how terrible was my reproach
and how many a city did we destroy while it was committing wrong so it is now fallen into ruin and how many an abandoned well and how many a lofty palace
so have they not traveled through the earth and have hearts by which to reason and ears by which to hear for indeed it is not eyes that are blinded but blinded are the hearts which are within the breasts
and they urge you to hasten the punishment but allah will never fail in his promise and indeed a day with your lord is like a thousand years of those which you count
and for how many a city did i prolong enjoyment while it was committing wrong then i seized it and to me is the final destination
say o people i am only to you a clear warner
and those who have believed and done righteous deeds for them is forgiveness and noble provision
but the ones who strove against our verses seeking to cause failure those are the companions of hellfire
and we did not send before you any messenger or prophet except that when he spoke or recited satan threw into it some misunderstanding but allah abolishes that which satan throws in then allah makes precise his verses and allah is knowing and wise
that is so he may make what satan throws in a trial for those within whose hearts is disease and those hard of heart and indeed the wrongdoers are in extreme dissension
and so those who were given knowledge may know that it is the truth from your lord and therefore believe in it and their hearts humbly submit to it and indeed is allah the guide of those who have believed to a straight path
but those who disbelieve will not cease to be in doubt of it until the hour comes upon them unexpectedly or there comes to them the punishment of a barren day
all sovereignty that day is for allah he will judge between them so they who believed and did righteous deeds will be in the gardens of pleasure
and they who disbelieved and denied our signs for those there will be a humiliating punishment
and those who emigrated for the cause of allah and then were killed or died allah will surely provide for them a good provision and indeed it is allah who is the best of providers
he will surely cause them to enter an entrance with which they will be pleased and indeed allah is knowing and forbearing
that is so and whoever responds to injustice with the equivalent of that with which he was harmed and then is tyrannized allah will surely aid him indeed allah is pardoning and forgiving
that is because allah causes the night to enter the day and causes the day to enter the night and because allah is hearing and seeing
that is because allah is the truth and that which they call upon other than him is falsehood and because allah is the most high the grand
do you not see that allah has sent down rain from the sky and the earth becomes green indeed allah is subtle and acquainted
to him belongs what is in the heavens and what is on the earth and indeed allah is the free of need the praiseworthy
do you not see that allah has subjected to you whatever is on the earth and the ships which run through the sea by his command and he restrains the sky from falling upon the earth unless by his permission indeed allah to the people is kind and merciful
and he is the one who gave you life then he causes you to die and then will again give you life indeed mankind is ungrateful
for every religion we have appointed rites which they perform so o muhammad let the disbelievers not contend with you over the matter but invite them to your lord indeed you are upon straight guidance
and if they dispute with you then say allah is most knowing of what you do
allah will judge between you on the day of resurrection concerning that over which you used to differ
do you not know that allah knows what is in the heaven and earth indeed that is in a record indeed that for allah is easy
and they worship besides allah that for which he has not sent down authority and that of which they have no knowledge and there will not be for the wrongdoers any helper
and when our verses are recited to them as clear evidences you recognize in the faces of those who disbelieve disapproval they are almost on the verge of assaulting those who recite to them our verses say then shall i inform you of what is worse than that it is the fire which allah has promised those who disbelieve and wretched is the destination
o people an example is presented so listen to it indeed those you invoke besides allah will never create as much as a fly even if they gathered together for that purpose and if the fly should steal away from them a tiny thing they could not recover it from him weak are the pursuer and pursued
they have not appraised allah with true appraisal indeed allah is powerful and exalted in might
allah chooses from the angels messengers and from the people indeed allah is hearing and seeing
he knows what is presently before them and what will be after them and to allah will be returned all matters
o you who have believed bow and prostrate and worship your lord and do good that you may succeed
and strive for allah with the striving due to him he has chosen you and has not placed upon you in the religion any difficulty it is the religion of your father abraham allah named you muslims before in former scriptures and in this revelation that the messenger may be a witness over you and you may be witnesses over the people so establish prayer and give zakah and hold fast to allah he is your protector and excellent is the protector and excellent is the helper
certainly will the believers have succeeded
they who are during their prayer humbly submissive
and they who turn away from ill speech
and they who are observant of zakah
and they who guard their private parts
except from their wives or those their right hands possess for indeed they will not be blamed
but whoever seeks beyond that then those are the transgressors
and they who are to their trusts and their promises attentive
and they who carefully maintain their prayers
those are the inheritors
who will inherit al firdaus they will abide therein eternally
and certainly did we create man from an extract of clay
then we placed him as a sperm drop in a firm lodging
then we made the sperm drop into a clinging clot and we made the clot into a lump of flesh and we made from the lump bones and we covered the bones with flesh then we developed him into another creation so blessed is allah the best of creators
then indeed after that you are to die
then indeed you on the day of resurrection will be resurrected
and we have created above you seven layered heavens and never have we been of our creation unaware
and we have sent down rain from the sky in a measured amount and settled it in the earth and indeed we are able to take it away
and we brought forth for you thereby gardens of palm trees and grapevines in which for you are abundant fruits and from which you eat
and we brought forth a tree issuing from mount sinai which produces oil and food for those who eat
and indeed for you in livestock is a lesson we give you drink from that which is in their bellies and for you in them are numerous benefits and from them you eat
and upon them and on ships you are carried
and we had certainly sent noah to his people and he said o my people worship allah you have no deity other than him then will you not fear him
but the eminent among those who disbelieved from his people said this is not but a man like yourselves who wishes to take precedence over you and if allah had willed to send a messenger he would have sent down angels we have not heard of this among our forefathers
he is not but a man possessed with madness so wait concerning him for a time
noah said my lord support me because they have denied me
so we inspired to him construct the ship under our observation and our inspiration and when our command comes and the oven overflows put into the ship from each creature two mates and your family except those for whom the decree of destruction has proceeded and do not address me concerning those who have wronged indeed they are to be drowned
and when you have boarded the ship you and those with you then say praise to allah who has saved us from the wrongdoing people
and say my lord let me land at a blessed landing place and you are the best to accommodate us
indeed in that are signs and indeed we are ever testing our servants
then we produced after them a generation of others
and we sent among them a messenger from themselves saying worship allah you have no deity other than him then will you not fear him
and the eminent among his people who disbelieved and denied the meeting of the hereafter while we had given them luxury in the worldly life said this is not but a man like yourselves he eats of that from which you eat and drinks of what you drink
and if you should obey a man like yourselves indeed you would then be losers
does he promise you that when you have died and become dust and bones that you will be brought forth once more
how far how far is that which you are promised
life is not but our worldly life we die and live but we will not be resurrected
he is not but a man who has invented a lie about allah and we will not believe him
he said my lord support me because they have denied me
allah said after a little they will surely become regretful
so the shriek seized them in truth and we made them as plant stubble then away with the wrongdoing people
then we produced after them other generations
no nation will precede its time of termination nor will they remain thereafter
then we sent our messengers in succession every time there came to a nation its messenger they denied him so we made them follow one another to destruction and we made them narrations so away with a people who do not believe
then we sent moses and his brother aaron with our signs and a clear authority
to pharaoh and his establishment but they were arrogant and were a haughty people
they said should we believe two men like ourselves while their people are for us in servitude
so they denied them and were of those destroyed
and we certainly gave moses the scripture that perhaps they would be guided
and we made the son of mary and his mother a sign and sheltered them within a high ground having level areas and flowing water
allah said o messengers eat from the good foods and work righteousness indeed i of what you do am knowing
and indeed this your religion is one religion and i am your lord so fear me
but the people divided their religion among them into sects each faction in what it has rejoicing
so leave them in their confusion for a time
do they think that what we extend to them of wealth and children
is because we hasten for them good things rather they do not perceive
indeed they who are apprehensive from fear of their lord
and they who believe in the signs of their lord
and they who do not associate anything with their lord
and they who give what they give while their hearts are fearful because they will be returning to their lord
it is those who hasten to good deeds and they outstrip others therein
and we charge no soul except with that within its capacity and with us is a record which speaks with truth and they will not be wronged
but their hearts are covered with confusion over this and they have evil deeds besides disbelief which they are doing
until when we seize their affluent ones with punishment at once they are crying to allah for help
do not cry out today indeed by us you will not be helped
my verses had already been recited to you but you were turning back on your heels
in arrogance regarding it conversing by night speaking evil
then have they not reflected over the qur an or has there come to them that which had not come to their forefathers
or did they not know their messenger so they are toward him disacknowledging
or do they say in him is madness rather he brought them the truth but most of them to the truth are averse
but if the truth had followed their inclinations the heavens and the earth and whoever is in them would have been ruined rather we have brought them their message but they from their message are turning away
or do you o muhammad ask them for payment but the reward of your lord is best and he is the best of providers
and indeed you invite them to a straight path
but indeed those who do not believe in the hereafter are deviating from the path
and even if we gave them mercy and removed what was upon them of affliction they would persist in their transgression wandering blindly
and we had gripped them with suffering as a warning but they did not yield to their lord nor did they humbly supplicate and will continue thus
until when we have opened before them a door of severe punishment immediately they will be therein in despair
and it is he who produced for you hearing and vision and hearts little are you grateful
and it is he who has multiplied you throughout the earth and to him you will be gathered
and it is he who gives life and causes death and his is the alternation of the night and the day then will you not reason
rather they say like what the former peoples said
they said when we have died and become dust and bones are we indeed to be resurrected
we have been promised this we and our forefathers before this is not but legends of the former peoples
say o muhammad to whom belongs the earth and whoever is in it if you should know
they will say to allah say then will you not remember
say who is lord of the seven heavens and lord of the great throne
they will say they belong to allah say then will you not fear him
say in whose hand is the realm of all things and he protects while none can protect against him if you should know
they will say all belongs to allah say then how are you deluded
rather we have brought them the truth and indeed they are liars
allah has not taken any son nor has there ever been with him any deity if there had been then each deity would have taken what it created and some of them would have sought to overcome others exalted is allah above what they describe concerning him
he is knower of the unseen and the witnessed so high is he above what they associate with him
say o muhammad my lord if you should show me that which they are promised
my lord then do not place me among the wrongdoing people
and indeed we are able to show you what we have promised them
repel by means of what is best their evil we are most knowing of what they describe
and say my lord i seek refuge in you from the incitements of the devils
and i seek refuge in you my lord lest they be present with me
for such is the state of the disbelievers until when death comes to one of them he says my lord send me back
that i might do righteousness in that which i left behind no it is only a word he is saying and behind them is a barrier until the day they are resurrected
so when the horn is blown no relationship will there be among them that day nor will they ask about one another
and those whose scales are heavy with good deeds it is they who are the successful
but those whose scales are light those are the ones who have lost their souls being in hell abiding eternally
the fire will sear their faces and they therein will have taut smiles
it will be said were not my verses recited to you and you used to deny them
they will say our lord our wretchedness overcame us and we were a people astray
our lord remove us from it and if we were to return to evil we would indeed be wrongdoers
he will say remain despised therein and do not speak to me
indeed there was a party of my servants who said our lord we have believed so forgive us and have mercy upon us and you are the best of the merciful
but you took them in mockery to the point that they made you forget my remembrance and you used to laugh at them
indeed i have rewarded them this day for their patient endurance that they are the attainers of success
allah will say how long did you remain on earth in number of years
they will say we remained a day or part of a day ask those who enumerate
he will say you stayed not but a little if only you had known
then did you think that we created you uselessly and that to us you would not be returned
so exalted is allah the sovereign the truth there is no deity except him lord of the noble throne
and whoever invokes besides allah another deity for which he has no proof then his account is only with his lord indeed the disbelievers will not succeed
and o muhammad say my lord forgive and have mercy and you are the best of the merciful
this is a surah which we have sent down and made that within it obligatory and revealed therein verses of clear evidence that you might remember
the unmarried woman or unmarried man found guilty of sexual intercourse lash each one of them with a hundred lashes and do not be taken by pity for them in the religion of allah if you should believe in allah and the last day and let a group of the believers witness their punishment
the fornicator does not marry except a female fornicator or polytheist and none marries her except a fornicator or a polytheist and that has been made unlawful to the believers
and those who accuse chaste women and then do not produce four witnesses lash them with eighty lashes and do not accept from them testimony ever after and those are the defiantly disobedient
except for those who repent thereafter and reform for indeed allah is forgiving and merciful
and those who accuse their wives of adultery and have no witnesses except themselves then the witness of one of them shall be four testimonies swearing by allah that indeed he is of the truthful
and the fifth oath will be that the curse of allah be upon him if he should be among the liars
but it will prevent punishment from her if she gives four testimonies swearing by allah that indeed he is of the liars
and the fifth oath will be that the wrath of allah be upon her if he was of the truthful
and if not for the favor of allah upon you and his mercy and because allah is accepting of repentance and wise
indeed those who came with falsehood are a group among you do not think it bad for you rather it is good for you for every person among them is what punishment he has earned from the sin and he who took upon himself the greater portion thereof for him is a great punishment
why when you heard it did not the believing men and believing women think good of one another and say this is an obvious falsehood
why did they who slandered not produce for it four witnesses and when they do not produce the witnesses then it is they in the sight of allah who are the liars
and if it had not been for the favor of allah upon you and his mercy in this world and the hereafter you would have been touched for that lie in which you were involved by a great punishment
when you received it with your tongues and said with your mouths that of which you had no knowledge and thought it was insignificant while it was in the sight of allah tremendous
and why when you heard it did you not say it is not for us to speak of this exalted are you o allah this is a great slander
allah warns you against returning to the likes of this conduct ever if you should be believers
and allah makes clear to you the verses and allah is knowing and wise
indeed those who like that immorality should be spread or publicized among those who have believed will have a painful punishment in this world and the hereafter and allah knows and you do not know
and if it had not been for the favor of allah upon you and his mercy and because allah is kind and merciful
o you who have believed do not follow the footsteps of satan and whoever follows the footsteps of satan indeed he enjoins immorality and wrongdoing and if not for the favor of allah upon you and his mercy not one of you would have been pure ever but allah purifies whom he wills and allah is hearing and knowing
and let not those of virtue among you and wealth swear not to give aid to their relatives and the needy and the emigrants for the cause of allah and let them pardon and overlook would you not like that allah should forgive you and allah is forgiving and merciful
indeed those who falsely accuse chaste unaware and believing women are cursed in this world and the hereafter and they will have a great punishment
on a day when their tongues their hands and their feet will bear witness against them as to what they used to do
that day allah will pay them in full their deserved recompense and they will know that it is allah who is the perfect in justice
evil words are for evil men and evil men are subjected to evil words and good words are for good men and good men are an object of good words those good people are declared innocent of what the slanderers say for them is forgiveness and noble provision
o you who have believed do not enter houses other than your own houses until you ascertain welcome and greet their inhabitants that is best for you perhaps you will be reminded
and if you do not find anyone therein do not enter them until permission has been given you and if it is said to you go back then go back it is purer for you and allah is knowing of what you do
there is no blame upon you for entering houses not inhabited in which there is convenience for you and allah knows what you reveal and what you conceal
tell the believing men to reduce some of their vision and guard their private parts that is purer for them indeed allah is acquainted with what they do
and tell the believing women to reduce some of their vision and guard their private parts and not expose their adornment except that which necessarily appears thereof and to wrap a portion of their headcovers over their chests and not expose their adornment except to their husbands their fathers their husbands fathers their sons their husbands sons their brothers their brothers sons their sisters sons their women that which their right hands possess or those male attendants having no physical desire or children who are not yet aware of the private aspects of women and let them not stamp their feet to make known what they conceal of their adornment and turn to allah in repentance all of you o believers that you might succeed
and marry the unmarried among you and the righteous among your male slaves and female slaves if they should be poor allah will enrich them from his bounty and allah is all encompassing and knowing
but let them who find not the means for marriage abstain from sexual relations until allah enriches them from his bounty and those who seek a contract for eventual emancipation from among whom your right hands possess then make a contract with them if you know there is within them goodness and give them from the wealth of allah which he has given you and do not compel your slave girls to prostitution if they desire chastity to seek thereby the temporary interests of worldly life and if someone should compel them then indeed allah is to them after their compulsion forgiving and merciful
and we have certainly sent down to you distinct verses and examples from those who passed on before you and an admonition for those who fear allah
allah is the light of the heavens and the earth the example of his light is like a niche within which is a lamp the lamp is within glass the glass as if it were a pearly white star lit from the oil of a blessed olive tree neither of the east nor of the west whose oil would almost glow even if untouched by fire light upon light allah guides to his light whom he wills and allah presents examples for the people and allah is knowing of all things
such niches are in mosques which allah has ordered to be raised and that his name be mentioned therein exalting him within them in the morning and the evenings
are men whom neither commerce nor sale distracts from the remembrance of allah and performance of prayer and giving of zakah they fear a day in which the hearts and eyes will fearfully turn about
that allah may reward them according to the best of what they did and increase them from his bounty and allah gives provision to whom he wills without account
but those who disbelieved their deeds are like a mirage in a lowland which a thirsty one thinks is water until when he comes to it he finds it is nothing but finds allah before him and he will pay him in full his due and allah is swift in account
or they are like darknesses within an unfathomable sea which is covered by waves upon which are waves over which are clouds darknesses some of them upon others when one puts out his hand therein he can hardly see it and he to whom allah has not granted light for him there is no light
do you not see that allah is exalted by whomever is within the heavens and the earth and by the birds with wings spread in flight each of them has known his means of prayer and exalting him and allah is knowing of what they do
and to allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and to allah is the destination
do you not see that allah drives clouds then he brings them together then he makes them into a mass and you see the rain emerge from within it and he sends down from the sky mountains of clouds within which is hail and he strikes with it whom he wills and averts it from whom he wills the flash of its lightening almost takes away the eyesight
allah alternates the night and the day indeed in that is a lesson for those who have vision
allah has created every living creature from water and of them are those that move on their bellies and of them are those that walk on two legs and of them are those that walk on four allah creates what he wills indeed allah is over all things competent
we have certainly sent down distinct verses and allah guides whom he wills to a straight path
but the hypocrites say we have believed in allah and in the messenger and we obey then a party of them turns away after that and those are not believers
and when they are called to the words of allah and his messenger to judge between them at once a party of them turns aside in refusal
but if the right is theirs they come to him in prompt obedience
is there disease in their hearts or have they doubted or do they fear that allah will be unjust to them or his messenger rather it is they who are the wrongdoers
the only statement of the true believers when they are called to allah and his messenger to judge between them is that they say we hear and we obey and those are the successful
and whoever obeys allah and his messenger and fears allah and is conscious of him it is those who are the attainers
and they swear by allah their strongest oaths that if you ordered them they would go forth in allah s cause say do not swear such obedience is known indeed allah is acquainted with that which you do
say obey allah and obey the messenger but if you turn away then upon him is only that duty with which he has been charged and upon you is that with which you have been charged and if you obey him you will be rightly guided and there is not upon the messenger except the responsibility for clear notification
allah has promised those who have believed among you and done righteous deeds that he will surely grant them succession to authority upon the earth just as he granted it to those before them and that he will surely establish for them therein their religion which he has preferred for them and that he will surely substitute for them after their fear security for they worship me not associating anything with me but whoever disbelieves after that then those are the defiantly disobedient
and establish prayer and give zakah and obey the messenger that you may receive mercy
never think that the disbelievers are causing failure to allah upon the earth their refuge will be the fire and how wretched the destination
o you who have believed let those whom your right hands possess and those who have not yet reached puberty among you ask permission of you before entering at three times before the dawn prayer and when you put aside your clothing for rest at noon and after the night prayer these are three times of privacy for you there is no blame upon you nor upon them beyond these periods for they continually circulate among you some of you among others thus does allah make clear to you the verses and allah is knowing and wise
and when the children among you reach puberty let them ask permission at all times as those before them have done thus does allah make clear to you his verses and allah is knowing and wise
and women of post menstrual age who have no desire for marriage there is no blame upon them for putting aside their outer garments but not displaying adornment but to modestly refrain from that is better for them and allah is hearing and knowing
there is not upon the blind any constraint nor upon the lame constraint nor upon the ill constraint nor upon yourselves when you eat from your own houses or the houses of your fathers or the houses of your mothers or the houses of your brothers or the houses of your sisters or the houses of your father s brothers or the houses of your father s sisters or the houses of your mother s brothers or the houses of your mother s sisters or from houses whose keys you possess or from the house of your friend there is no blame upon you whether you eat together or separately but when you enter houses give greetings of peace upon each other a greeting from allah blessed and good thus does allah make clear to you the verses of ordinance that you may understand
the believers are only those who believe in allah and his messenger and when they are meeting with him for a matter of common interest do not depart until they have asked his permission indeed those who ask your permission o muhammad those are the ones who believe in allah and his messenger so when they ask your permission for something of their affairs then give permission to whom you will among them and ask forgiveness for them of allah indeed allah is forgiving and merciful
do not make your calling of the messenger among yourselves as the call of one of you to another already allah knows those of you who slip away concealed by others so let those beware who dissent from the prophet s order lest fitnah strike them or a painful punishment
unquestionably to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and earth already he knows that upon which you stand and knows the day when they will be returned to him and he will inform them of what they have done and allah is knowing of all things
blessed is he who sent down the criterion upon his servant that he may be to the worlds a warner
he to whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and who has not taken a son and has not had a partner in dominion and has created each thing and determined it with precise determination
but they have taken besides him gods which create nothing while they are created and possess not for themselves any harm or benefit and possess not power to cause death or life or resurrection
and those who disbelieve say this qur an is not except a falsehood he invented and another people assisted him in it but they have committed an injustice and a lie
and they say legends of the former peoples which he has written down and they are dictated to him morning and afternoon
say o muhammad it has been revealed by he who knows every secret within the heavens and the earth indeed he is ever forgiving and merciful
and they say what is this messenger that eats food and walks in the markets why was there not sent down to him an angel so he would be with him a warner
or why is not a treasure presented to him from heaven or does he not have a garden from which he eats and the wrongdoers say you follow not but a man affected by magic
look how they strike for you comparisons but they have strayed so they cannot find a way
blessed is he who if he willed could have made for you something better than that gardens beneath which rivers flow and could make for you palaces
but they have denied the hour and we have prepared for those who deny the hour a blaze
when the hellfire sees them from a distant place they will hear its fury and roaring
and when they are thrown into a narrow place therein bound in chains they will cry out thereupon for destruction
they will be told do not cry this day for one destruction but cry for much destruction
say is that better or the garden of eternity which is promised to the righteous it will be for them a reward and destination
for them therein is whatever they wish while abiding eternally it is ever upon your lord a promise worthy to be requested
and mention the day he will gather them and that which they worship besides allah and will say did you mislead these my servants or did they themselves stray from the way
they will say exalted are you it was not for us to take besides you any allies but you provided comforts for them and their fathers until they forgot the message and became a people ruined
so they will deny you disbelievers in what you say and you cannot avert punishment or find help and whoever commits injustice among you we will make him taste a great punishment
and we did not send before you o muhammad any of the messengers except that they ate food and walked in the markets and we have made some of you people as trial for others will you have patience and ever is your lord seeing
and those who do not expect the meeting with us say why were not angels sent down to us or why do we not see our lord they have certainly become arrogant within themselves and become insolent with great insolence
the day they see the angels no good tidings will there be that day for the criminals and the angels will say prevented and inaccessible
and we will regard what they have done of deeds and make them as dust dispersed
the companions of paradise that day are in a better settlement and better resting place
and mention the day when the heaven will split open with emerging clouds and the angels will be sent down in successive descent
true sovereignty that day is for the most merciful and it will be upon the disbelievers a difficult day
and the day the wrongdoer will bite on his hands in regret he will say oh i wish i had taken with the messenger a way
oh woe to me i wish i had not taken that one as a friend
he led me away from the remembrance after it had come to me and ever is satan to man a deserter
and the messenger has said o my lord indeed my people have taken this qur an as a thing abandoned
and thus have we made for every prophet an enemy from among the criminals but sufficient is your lord as a guide and a helper
and those who disbelieve say why was the qur an not revealed to him all at once thus it is that we may strengthen thereby your heart and we have spaced it distinctly
and they do not come to you with an argument except that we bring you the truth and the best explanation
the ones who are gathered on their faces to hell those are the worst in position and farthest astray in their way
and we had certainly given moses the scripture and appointed with him his brother aaron as an assistant
and we said go both of you to the people who have denied our signs then we destroyed them with complete destruction
and the people of noah when they denied the messengers we drowned them and we made them for mankind a sign and we have prepared for the wrongdoers a painful punishment
and we destroyed aad and thamud and the companions of the well and many generations between them
and for each we presented examples as warnings and each we destroyed with total destruction
and they have already come upon the town which was showered with a rain of evil so have they not seen it but they are not expecting resurrection
and when they see you o muhammad they take you not except in ridicule saying is this the one whom allah has sent as a messenger
he almost would have misled us from our gods had we not been steadfast in worship of them but they are going to know when they see the punishment who is farthest astray in his way
have you seen the one who takes as his god his own desire then would you be responsible for him
or do you think that most of them hear or reason they are not except like livestock rather they are even more astray in their way
have you not considered your lord how he extends the shadow and if he willed he could have made it stationary then we made the sun for it an indication
then we hold it in hand for a brief grasp
and it is he who has made the night for you as clothing and sleep a means for rest and has made the day a resurrection
and it is he who sends the winds as good tidings before his mercy and we send down from the sky pure water
that we may bring to life thereby a dead land and give it as drink to those we created of numerous livestock and men
and we have certainly distributed it among them that they might be reminded but most of the people refuse except disbelief
and if we had willed we could have sent into every city a warner
so do not obey the disbelievers and strive against them with the qur an a great striving
and it is he who has released simultaneously the two seas one fresh and sweet and one salty and bitter and he placed between them a barrier and prohibiting partition
and it is he who has created from water a human being and made him a relative by lineage and marriage and ever is your lord competent concerning creation
but they worship rather than allah that which does not benefit them or harm them and the disbeliever is ever against his lord an assistant to satan
and we have not sent you o muhammad except as a bringer of good tidings and a warner
say i do not ask of you for it any payment only that whoever wills might take to his lord a way
and rely upon the ever living who does not die and exalt allah with his praise and sufficient is he to be with the sins of his servants acquainted
he who created the heavens and the earth and what is between them in six days and then established himself above the throne the most merciful so ask about him one well informed
and when it is said to them prostrate to the most merciful they say and what is the most merciful should we prostrate to that which you order us and it increases them in aversion
blessed is he who has placed in the sky great stars and placed therein a burning lamp and luminous moon
and it is he who has made the night and the day in succession for whoever desires to remember or desires gratitude
and the servants of the most merciful are those who walk upon the earth easily and when the ignorant address them harshly they say words of peace
and those who spend part of the night to their lord prostrating and standing in prayer
and those who say our lord avert from us the punishment of hell indeed its punishment is ever adhering
indeed it is evil as a settlement and residence
and they are those who when they spend do so not excessively or sparingly but are ever between that justly moderate
and those who do not invoke with allah another deity or kill the soul which allah has forbidden to be killed except by right and do not commit unlawful sexual intercourse and whoever should do that will meet a penalty
multiplied for him is the punishment on the day of resurrection and he will abide therein humiliated
except for those who repent believe and do righteous work for them allah will replace their evil deeds with good and ever is allah forgiving and merciful
and he who repents and does righteousness does indeed turn to allah with accepted repentance
and they are those who do not testify to falsehood and when they pass near ill speech they pass by with dignity
and those who when reminded of the verses of their lord do not fall upon them deaf and blind
and those who say our lord grant us from among our wives and offspring comfort to our eyes and make us an example for the righteous
those will be awarded the chamber for what they patiently endured and they will be received therein with greetings and words of peace
abiding eternally therein good is the settlement and residence
say what would my lord care for you if not for your supplication for you disbelievers have denied so your denial is going to be adherent
ta seen meem
these are the verses of the clear book
perhaps o muhammad you would kill yourself with grief that they will not be believers
if we willed we could send down to them from the sky a sign for which their necks would remain humbled
and no revelation comes to them anew from the most merciful except that they turn away from it
for they have already denied but there will come to them the news of that which they used to ridicule
did they not look at the earth how much we have produced therein from every noble kind
indeed in that is a sign but most of them were not to be believers
and indeed your lord he is the exalted in might the merciful
and mention when your lord called moses saying go to the wrongdoing people
the people of pharaoh will they not fear allah
he said my lord indeed i fear that they will deny me
and that my breast will tighten and my tongue will not be fluent so send for aaron
and they have upon me a claim due to sin so i fear that they will kill me
allah said no go both of you with our signs indeed we are with you listening
go to pharaoh and say we are the messengers of the lord of the worlds
commanded to say send with us the children of israel
pharaoh said did we not raise you among us as a child and you remained among us for years of your life
and then you did your deed which you did and you were of the ungrateful
moses said i did it then while i was of those astray
so i fled from you when i feared you then my lord granted me wisdom and prophethood and appointed me as one of the messengers
and is this a favor of which you remind me that you have enslaved the children of israel
said pharaoh and what is the lord of the worlds
moses said the lord of the heavens and earth and that between them if you should be convinced
pharaoh said to those around him do you not hear
moses said your lord and the lord of your first forefathers
pharaoh said indeed your messenger who has been sent to you is mad
moses said lord of the east and the west and that between them if you were to reason
pharaoh said if you take a god other than me i will surely place you among those imprisoned
moses said even if i brought you proof manifest
pharaoh said then bring it if you should be of the truthful
so moses threw his staff and suddenly it was a serpent manifest
and he drew out his hand thereupon it was white for the observers
pharaoh said to the eminent ones around him indeed this is a learned magician
he wants to drive you out of your land by his magic so what do you advise
they said postpone the matter of him and his brother and send among the cities gatherers
who will bring you every learned skilled magician
so the magicians were assembled for the appointment of a well known day
and it was said to the people will you congregate
that we might follow the magicians if they are the predominant
and when the magicians arrived they said to pharaoh is there indeed for us a reward if we are the predominant
he said yes and indeed you will then be of those near to me
moses said to them throw whatever you will throw
so they threw their ropes and their staffs and said by the might of pharaoh indeed it is we who are predominant
then moses threw his staff and at once it devoured what they falsified
so the magicians fell down in prostration to allah
they said we have believed in the lord of the worlds
the lord of moses and aaron
pharaoh said you believed moses before i gave you permission indeed he is your leader who has taught you magic but you are going to know i will surely cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides and i will surely crucify you all
they said no harm indeed to our lord we will return
indeed we aspire that our lord will forgive us our sins because we were the first of the believers
and we inspired to moses travel by night with my servants indeed you will be pursued
then pharaoh sent among the cities gatherers
and said indeed those are but a small band
and indeed they are enraging us
and indeed we are a cautious society
so we removed them from gardens and springs
and treasures and honorable station
thus and we caused to inherit it the children of israel
so they pursued them at sunrise
and when the two companies saw one another the companions of moses said indeed we are to be overtaken
moses said no indeed with me is my lord he will guide me
then we inspired to moses strike with your staff the sea and it parted and each portion was like a great towering mountain
and we advanced thereto the pursuers
and we saved moses and those with him all together
then we drowned the others
indeed in that is a sign but most of them were not to be believers
and indeed your lord he is the exalted in might the merciful
and recite to them the news of abraham
when he said to his father and his people what do you worship
they said we worship idols and remain to them devoted
he said do they hear you when you supplicate
or do they benefit you or do they harm
they said but we found our fathers doing thus
he said then do you see what you have been worshipping
you and your ancient forefathers
indeed they are enemies to me except the lord of the worlds
who created me and he it is who guides me
and it is he who feeds me and gives me drink
and when i am ill it is he who cures me
and who will cause me to die and then bring me to life
and who i aspire that he will forgive me my sin on the day of recompense
and he said my lord grant me authority and join me with the righteous
and grant me a reputation of honor among later generations
and place me among the inheritors of the garden of pleasure
and forgive my father indeed he has been of those astray
and do not disgrace me on the day they are all resurrected
the day when there will not benefit anyone wealth or children
but only one who comes to allah with a sound heart
and paradise will be brought near that day to the righteous
and hellfire will be brought forth for the deviators
and it will be said to them where are those you used to worship
other than allah can they help you or help themselves
so they will be overturned into hellfire they and the deviators
and the soldiers of iblees all together
they will say while they dispute therein
by allah we were indeed in manifest error
when we equated you with the lord of the worlds
and no one misguided us except the criminals
so now we have no intercessors
and not a devoted friend
then if we only had a return to the world and could be of the believers
indeed in that is a sign but most of them were not to be believers
and indeed your lord he is the exalted in might the merciful
the people of noah denied the messengers
when their brother noah said to them will you not fear allah
indeed i am to you a trustworthy messenger
so fear allah and obey me
and i do not ask you for it any payment my payment is only from the lord of the worlds
so fear allah and obey me
they said should we believe you while you are followed by the lowest class of people
he said and what is my knowledge of what they used to do
their account is only upon my lord if you could perceive
and i am not one to drive away the believers
i am only a clear warner
they said if you do not desist o noah you will surely be of those who are stoned
he said my lord indeed my people have denied me
then judge between me and them with decisive judgement and save me and those with me of the believers
so we saved him and those with him in the laden ship
then we drowned thereafter the remaining ones
indeed in that is a sign but most of them were not to be believers
and indeed your lord he is the exalted in might the merciful
aad denied the messengers
when their brother hud said to them will you not fear allah
indeed i am to you a trustworthy messenger
so fear allah and obey me
and i do not ask you for it any payment my payment is only from the lord of the worlds
do you construct on every elevation a sign amusing yourselves
and take for yourselves palaces and fortresses that you might abide eternally
and when you strike you strike as tyrants
so fear allah and obey me
and fear he who provided you with that which you know
provided you with grazing livestock and children
and gardens and springs
indeed i fear for you the punishment of a terrible day
they said it is all the same to us whether you advise or are not of the advisors
this is not but the custom of the former peoples
and we are not to be punished
and they denied him so we destroyed them indeed in that is a sign but most of them were not to be believers
and indeed your lord he is the exalted in might the merciful
thamud denied the messengers
when their brother salih said to them will you not fear allah
indeed i am to you a trustworthy messenger
so fear allah and obey me
and i do not ask you for it any payment my payment is only from the lord of the worlds
will you be left in what is here secure from death
within gardens and springs
and fields of crops and palm trees with softened fruit
and you carve out of the mountains homes with skill
so fear allah and obey me
and do not obey the order of the transgressors
who cause corruption in the land and do not amend
they said you are only of those affected by magic
you are but a man like ourselves so bring a sign if you should be of the truthful
he said this is a she camel for her is a time of drink and for you is a time of drink each on a known day
and do not touch her with harm lest you be seized by the punishment of a terrible day
but they hamstrung her and so became regretful
and the punishment seized them indeed in that is a sign but most of them were not to be believers
and indeed your lord he is the exalted in might the merciful
the people of lot denied the messengers
when their brother lot said to them will you not fear allah
indeed i am to you a trustworthy messenger
so fear allah and obey me
and i do not ask you for it any payment my payment is only from the lord of the worlds
do you approach males among the worlds
and leave what your lord has created for you as mates but you are a people transgressing
they said if you do not desist o lot you will surely be of those evicted
he said indeed i am toward your deed of those who detest it
my lord save me and my family from the consequence of what they do
so we saved him and his family all
except an old woman among those who remained behind
then we destroyed the others
and we rained upon them a rain of stones and evil was the rain of those who were warned
indeed in that is a sign but most of them were not to be believers
and indeed your lord he is the exalted in might the merciful
the companions of the thicket denied the messengers
when shu ayb said to them will you not fear allah
indeed i am to you a trustworthy messenger
so fear allah and obey me
and i do not ask you for it any payment my payment is only from the lord of the worlds
give full measure and do not be of those who cause loss
and weigh with an even balance
and do not deprive people of their due and do not commit abuse on earth spreading corruption
and fear he who created you and the former creation
they said you are only of those affected by magic
you are but a man like ourselves and indeed we think you are among the liars
so cause to fall upon us fragments of the sky if you should be of the truthful
he said my lord is most knowing of what you do
and they denied him so the punishment of the day of the black cloud seized them indeed it was the punishment of a terrible day
indeed in that is a sign but most of them were not to be believers
and indeed your lord he is the exalted in might the merciful
and indeed the qur an is the revelation of the lord of the worlds
the trustworthy spirit has brought it down
upon your heart o muhammad that you may be of the warners
in a clear arabic language
and indeed it is mentioned in the scriptures of former peoples
and has it not been a sign to them that it is recognized by the scholars of the children of israel
and even if we had revealed it to one among the foreigners
and he had recited it to them perfectly they would still not have been believers in it
thus have we inserted disbelief into the hearts of the criminals
they will not believe in it until they see the painful punishment
and it will come to them suddenly while they perceive it not
and they will say may we be reprieved
so for our punishment are they impatient
then have you considered if we gave them enjoyment for years
and then there came to them that which they were promised
they would not be availed by the enjoyment with which they were provided
and we did not destroy any city except that it had warners
as a reminder and never have we been unjust
and the devils have not brought the revelation down
it is not allowable for them nor would they be able
indeed they from its hearing are removed
so do not invoke with allah another deity and thus be among the punished
and warn o muhammad your closest kindred
and lower your wing to those who follow you of the believers
and if they disobey you then say indeed i am disassociated from what you are doing
and rely upon the exalted in might the merciful
who sees you when you arise
and your movement among those who prostrate
indeed he is the hearing the knowing
shall i inform you upon whom the devils descend
they descend upon every sinful liar
they pass on what is heard and most of them are liars
and the poets only the deviators follow them
do you not see that in every valley they roam
and that they say what they do not do
except those poets who believe and do righteous deeds and remember allah often and defend the muslims after they were wronged and those who have wronged are going to know to what kind of return they will be returned
ta seen these are the verses of the qur an and a clear book
as guidance and good tidings for the believers
who establish prayer and give zakah and of the hereafter they are certain in faith
indeed for those who do not believe in the hereafter we have made pleasing to them their deeds so they wander blindly
those are the ones for whom there will be the worst of punishment and in the hereafter they are the greatest losers
and indeed o muhammad you receive the qur an from one wise and knowing
mention when moses said to his family indeed i have perceived a fire i will bring you from there information or will bring you a burning torch that you may warm yourselves
but when he came to it he was called blessed is whoever is at the fire and whoever is around it and exalted is allah lord of the worlds
o moses indeed it is i allah the exalted in might the wise
and he was told throw down your staff but when he saw it writhing as if it were a snake he turned in flight and did not return allah said o moses fear not indeed in my presence the messengers do not fear
otherwise he who wrongs then substitutes good after evil indeed i am forgiving and merciful
and put your hand into the opening of your garment at the breast it will come out white without disease these are among the nine signs you will take to pharaoh and his people indeed they have been a people defiantly disobedient
but when there came to them our visible signs they said this is obvious magic
and they rejected them while their inner selves were convinced thereof out of injustice and haughtiness so see how was the end of the corrupters
and we had certainly given to david and solomon knowledge and they said praise is due to allah who has favored us over many of his believing servants
and solomon inherited david he said o people we have been taught the language of birds and we have been given from all things indeed this is evident bounty
and gathered for solomon were his soldiers of the jinn and men and birds and they were marching in rows
until when they came upon the valley of the ants an ant said o ants enter your dwellings that you not be crushed by solomon and his soldiers while they perceive not
so solomon smiled amused at her speech and said my lord enable me to be grateful for your favor which you have bestowed upon me and upon my parents and to do righteousness of which you approve and admit me by your mercy into the ranks of your righteous servants
and he took attendance of the birds and said why do i not see the hoopoe or is he among the absent
i will surely punish him with a severe punishment or slaughter him unless he brings me clear authorization
but the hoopoe stayed not long and said i have encompassed in knowledge that which you have not encompassed and i have come to you from sheba with certain news
indeed i found there a woman ruling them and she has been given of all things and she has a great throne
i found her and her people prostrating to the sun instead of allah and satan has made their deeds pleasing to them and averted them from his way so they are not guided
and so they do not prostrate to allah who brings forth what is hidden within the heavens and the earth and knows what you conceal and what you declare
allah there is no deity except him lord of the great throne
solomon said we will see whether you were truthful or were of the liars
take this letter of mine and deliver it to them then leave them and see what answer they will return
she said o eminent ones indeed to me has been delivered a noble letter
indeed it is from solomon and indeed it reads in the name of allah the entirely merciful the especially merciful
be not haughty with me but come to me in submission as muslims
she said o eminent ones advise me in my affair i would not decide a matter until you witness for me
they said we are men of strength and of great military might but the command is yours so see what you will command
she said indeed kings when they enter a city they ruin it and render the honored of its people humbled and thus do they do
but indeed i will send to them a gift and see with what reply the messengers will return
so when they came to solomon he said do you provide me with wealth but what allah has given me is better than what he has given you rather it is you who rejoice in your gift
return to them for we will surely come to them with soldiers that they will be powerless to encounter and we will surely expel them therefrom in humiliation and they will be debased
solomon said o assembly of jinn which of you will bring me her throne before they come to me in submission
a powerful one from among the jinn said i will bring it to you before you rise from your place and indeed i am for this task strong and trustworthy
said one who had knowledge from the scripture i will bring it to you before your glance returns to you and when solomon saw it placed before him he said this is from the favor of my lord to test me whether i will be grateful or ungrateful and whoever is grateful his gratitude is only for the benefit of himself and whoever is ungrateful then indeed my lord is free of need and generous
he said disguise for her her throne we will see whether she will be guided to truth or will be of those who is not guided
so when she arrived it was said to her is your throne like this she said it is as though it was it solomon said and we were given knowledge before her and we have been muslims in submission to allah
and that which she was worshipping other than allah had averted her from submission to him indeed she was from a disbelieving people
she was told enter the palace but when she saw it she thought it was a body of water and uncovered her shins to wade through he said indeed it is a palace whose floor is made smooth with glass she said my lord indeed i have wronged myself and i submit with solomon to allah lord of the worlds
and we had certainly sent to thamud their brother salih saying worship allah and at once they were two parties conflicting
he said o my people why are you impatient for evil instead of good why do you not seek forgiveness of allah that you may receive mercy
they said we consider you a bad omen you and those with you he said your omen is with allah rather you are a people being tested
and there were in the city nine family heads causing corruption in the land and not amending its affairs
they said take a mutual oath by allah that we will kill him by night he and his family then we will say to his executor we did not witness the destruction of his family and indeed we are truthful
and they planned a plan and we planned a plan while they perceived not
then look how was the outcome of their plan that we destroyed them and their people all
so those are their houses desolate because of the wrong they had done indeed in that is a sign for people who know
and we saved those who believed and used to fear allah
and mention lot when he said to his people do you commit immorality while you are seeing
do you indeed approach men with desire instead of women rather you are a people behaving ignorantly
but the answer of his people was not except that they said expel the family of lot from your city indeed they are people who keep themselves pure
so we saved him and his family except for his wife we destined her to be of those who remained behind
and we rained upon them a rain of stones and evil was the rain of those who were warned
say o muhammad praise be to allah and peace upon his servants whom he has chosen is allah better or what they associate with him
more precisely is he not best who created the heavens and the earth and sent down for you rain from the sky causing to grow thereby gardens of joyful beauty which you could not otherwise have grown the trees thereof is there a deity with allah no but they are a people who ascribe equals to him
is he not best who made the earth a stable ground and placed within it rivers and made for it firmly set mountains and placed between the two seas a barrier is there a deity with allah no but most of them do not know
is he not best who responds to the desperate one when he calls upon him and removes evil and makes you inheritors of the earth is there a deity with allah little do you remember
is he not best who guides you through the darknesses of the land and sea and who sends the winds as good tidings before his mercy is there a deity with allah high is allah above whatever they associate with him
is he not best who begins creation and then repeats it and who provides for you from the heaven and earth is there a deity with allah say produce your proof if you should be truthful
say none in the heavens and earth knows the unseen except allah and they do not perceive when they will be resurrected
rather their knowledge is arrested concerning the hereafter rather they are in doubt about it rather they are concerning it blind
and those who disbelieve say when we have become dust as well as our forefathers will we indeed be brought out of the graves
we have been promised this we and our forefathers before this is not but legends of the former peoples
say o muhammad travel through the land and observe how was the end of the criminals
and grieve not over them or be in distress from what they conspire
and they say when is the fulfillment of this promise if you should be truthful
say perhaps it is close behind you some of that for which you are impatient
and indeed your lord is full of bounty for the people but most of them do not show gratitude
and indeed your lord knows what their breasts conceal and what they declare
and there is nothing concealed within the heaven and the earth except that it is in a clear register
indeed this qur an relates to the children of israel most of that over which they disagree
and indeed it is guidance and mercy for the believers
indeed your lord will judge between them by his wise judgement and he is the exalted in might the knowing
so rely upon allah indeed you are upon the clear truth
indeed you will not make the dead hear nor will you make the deaf hear the call when they have turned their backs retreating
and you cannot guide the blind away from their error you will only make hear those who believe in our verses so they are muslims submitting to allah
and when the word befalls them we will bring forth for them a creature from the earth speaking to them saying that the people were of our verses not certain in faith
and warn of the day when we will gather from every nation a company of those who deny our signs and they will be driven in rows
until when they arrive at the place of judgement he will say did you deny my signs while you encompassed them not in knowledge or what was it that you were doing
and the decree will befall them for the wrong they did and they will not be able to speak
do they not see that we made the night that they may rest therein and the day giving sight indeed in that are signs for a people who believe
and warn of the day the horn will be blown and whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth will be terrified except whom allah wills and all will come to him humbled
and you see the mountains thinking them rigid while they will pass as the passing of clouds it is the work of allah who perfected all things indeed he is acquainted with that which you do
whoever comes at judgement with a good deed will have better than it and they from the terror of that day will be safe
and whoever comes with an evil deed their faces will be overturned into the fire and it will be said are you recompensed except for what you used to do
say o muhammad i have only been commanded to worship the lord of this city who made it sacred and to whom belongs all things and i am commanded to be of the muslims those who submit to allah
and to recite the qur an and whoever is guided is only guided for the benefit of himself and whoever strays say i am only one of the warners
and say all praise is due to allah he will show you his signs and you will recognize them and your lord is not unaware of what you do
ta seen meem
these are the verses of the clear book
we recite to you from the news of moses and pharaoh in truth for a people who believe
indeed pharaoh exalted himself in the land and made its people into factions oppressing a sector among them slaughtering their newborn sons and keeping their females alive indeed he was of the corrupters
and we wanted to confer favor upon those who were oppressed in the land and make them leaders and make them inheritors
and establish them in the land and show pharaoh and his minister haman and their soldiers through them that which they had feared
and we inspired to the mother of moses suckle him but when you fear for him cast him into the river and do not fear and do not grieve indeed we will return him to you and will make him one of the messengers
and the family of pharaoh picked him up out of the river so that he would become to them an enemy and a cause of grief indeed pharaoh and haman and their soldiers were deliberate sinners
and the wife of pharaoh said he will be a comfort of the eye for me and for you do not kill him perhaps he may benefit us or we may adopt him as a son and they perceived not
and the heart of moses mother became empty of all else she was about to disclose the matter concerning him had we not bound fast her heart that she would be of the believers
and she said to his sister follow him so she watched him from a distance while they perceived not
and we had prevented from him all wet nurses before so she said shall i direct you to a household that will be responsible for him for you while they are to him for his upbringing sincere
so we restored him to his mother that she might be content and not grieve and that she would know that the promise of allah is true but most of the people do not know
and when he attained his full strength and was mentally mature we bestowed upon him judgement and knowledge and thus do we reward the doers of good
and he entered the city at a time of inattention by its people and found therein two men fighting one from his faction and one from among his enemy and the one from his faction called for help to him against the one from his enemy so moses struck him and unintentionally killed him moses said this is from the work of satan indeed he is a manifest misleading enemy
he said my lord indeed i have wronged myself so forgive me and he forgave him indeed he is the forgiving the merciful
he said my lord for the favor you bestowed upon me i will never be an assistant to the criminals
and he became inside the city fearful and anticipating exposure when suddenly the one who sought his help the previous day cried out to him once again moses said to him indeed you are an evident persistent deviator
and when he wanted to strike the one who was an enemy to both of them he said o moses do you intend to kill me as you killed someone yesterday you only want to be a tyrant in the land and do not want to be of the amenders
and a man came from the farthest end of the city running he said o moses indeed the eminent ones are conferring over you intending to kill you so leave the city indeed i am to you of the sincere advisors
so he left it fearful and anticipating apprehension he said my lord save me from the wrongdoing people
and when he directed himself toward madyan he said perhaps my lord will guide me to the sound way
and when he came to the well of madyan he found there a crowd of people watering their flocks and he found aside from them two women driving back their flocks he said what is your circumstance they said we do not water until the shepherds dispatch their flocks and our father is an old man
so he watered their flocks for them then he went back to the shade and said my lord indeed i am for whatever good you would send down to me in need
then one of the two women came to him walking with shyness she said indeed my father invites you that he may reward you for having watered for us so when he came to him and related to him the story he said fear not you have escaped from the wrongdoing people
one of the women said o my father hire him indeed the best one you can hire is the strong and the trustworthy
he said indeed i wish to wed you one of these my two daughters on the condition that you serve me for eight years but if you complete ten it will be as a favor from you and i do not wish to put you in difficulty you will find me if allah wills from among the righteous
moses said that is established between me and you whichever of the two terms i complete there is no injustice to me and allah over what we say is witness
and when moses had completed the term and was traveling with his family he perceived from the direction of the mount a fire he said to his family stay here indeed i have perceived a fire perhaps i will bring you from there some information or burning wood from the fire that you may warm yourselves
but when he came to it he was called from the right side of the valley in a blessed spot from the tree o moses indeed i am allah lord of the worlds
and he was told throw down your staff but when he saw it writhing as if it was a snake he turned in flight and did not return allah said o moses approach and fear not indeed you are of the secure
insert your hand into the opening of your garment it will come out white without disease and draw in your arm close to you as prevention from fear for those are two proofs from your lord to pharaoh and his establishment indeed they have been a people defiantly disobedient
he said my lord indeed i killed from among them someone and i fear they will kill me
and my brother aaron is more fluent than me in tongue so send him with me as support verifying me indeed i fear that they will deny me
allah said we will strengthen your arm through your brother and grant you both supremacy so they will not reach you it will be through our signs you and those who follow you will be the predominant
but when moses came to them with our signs as clear evidences they said this is not except invented magic and we have not heard of this religion among our forefathers
and moses said my lord is more knowing than we or you of who has come with guidance from him and to whom will be succession in the home indeed wrongdoers do not succeed
and pharaoh said o eminent ones i have not known you to have a god other than me then ignite for me o haman a fire upon the clay and make for me a tower that i may look at the god of moses and indeed i do think he is among the liars
and he was arrogant he and his soldiers in the land without right and they thought that they would not be returned to us
so we took him and his soldiers and threw them into the sea so see how was the end of the wrongdoers
and we made them leaders inviting to the fire and on the day of resurrection they will not be helped
and we caused to overtake them in this world a curse and on the day of resurrection they will be of the despised
and we gave moses the scripture after we had destroyed the former generations as enlightenment for the people and guidance and mercy that they might be reminded
and you o muhammad were not on the western side of the mount when we revealed to moses the command and you were not among the witnesses to that
but we produced many generations after moses and prolonged was their duration and you were not a resident among the people of madyan reciting to them our verses but we were senders of this message
and you were not at the side of the mount when we called moses but were sent as a mercy from your lord to warn a people to whom no warner had come before you that they might be reminded
and if not that a disaster should strike them for what their hands put forth of sins and they would say our lord why did you not send us a messenger so we could have followed your verses and been among the believers
but when the truth came to them from us they said why was he not given like that which was given to moses did they not disbelieve in that which was given to moses before they said they are but two works of magic supporting each other and indeed we are in both disbelievers
say then bring a scripture from allah which is more guiding than either of them that i may follow it if you should be truthful
but if they do not respond to you then know that they only follow their own desires and who is more astray than one who follows his desire without guidance from allah indeed allah does not guide the wrongdoing people
and we have repeatedly conveyed to them the qur an that they might be reminded
those to whom we gave the scripture before it they are believers in it
and when it is recited to them they say we have believed in it indeed it is the truth from our lord indeed we were even before it muslims submitting to allah
those will be given their reward twice for what they patiently endured and because they avert evil through good and from what we have provided them they spend
and when they hear ill speech they turn away from it and say for us are our deeds and for you are your deeds peace will be upon you we seek not the ignorant
indeed o muhammad you do not guide whom you like but allah guides whom he wills and he is most knowing of the rightly guided
and they say if we were to follow the guidance with you we would be swept from our land have we not established for them a safe sanctuary to which are brought the fruits of all things as provision from us but most of them do not know
and how many a city have we destroyed that was insolent in its way of living and those are their dwellings which have not been inhabited after them except briefly and it is we who were the inheritors
and never would your lord have destroyed the cities until he had sent to their mother a messenger reciting to them our verses and we would not destroy the cities except while their people were wrongdoers
and whatever thing you people have been given it is only for the enjoyment of worldly life and its adornment and what is with allah is better and more lasting so will you not use reason
then is he whom we have promised a good promise which he will obtain like he for whom we provided enjoyment of worldly life but then he is on the day of resurrection among those presented for punishment in hell
and warn of the day he will call them and say where are my partners which you used to claim
those upon whom the word will have come into effect will say our lord these are the ones we led to error we led them to error just as we were in error we declare our disassociation from them to you they did not used to worship us
and it will be said invoke your partners and they will invoke them but they will not respond to them and they will see the punishment if only they had followed guidance
and mention the day he will call them and say what did you answer the messengers
but the information will be unapparent to them that day so they will not be able to ask one another
but as for one who had repented believed and done righteousness it is promised by allah that he will be among the successful
and your lord creates what he wills and chooses not for them was the choice exalted is allah and high above what they associate with him
and your lord knows what their breasts conceal and what they declare
and he is allah there is no deity except him to him is due all praise in the first life and the hereafter and his is the final decision and to him you will be returned
say have you considered if allah should make for you the night continuous until the day of resurrection what deity other than allah could bring you light then will you not hear
say have you considered if allah should make for you the day continuous until the day of resurrection what deity other than allah could bring you a night in which you may rest then will you not see
and out of his mercy he made for you the night and the day that you may rest therein and by day seek from his bounty and that perhaps you will be grateful
and warn of the day he will call them and say where are my partners which you used to claim
and we will extract from every nation a witness and say produce your proof and they will know that the truth belongs to allah and lost from them is that which they used to invent
indeed qarun was from the people of moses but he tyrannized them and we gave him of treasures whose keys would burden a band of strong men thereupon his people said to him do not exult indeed allah does not like the exultant
but seek through that which allah has given you the home of the hereafter and yet do not forget your share of the world and do good as allah has done good to you and desire not corruption in the land indeed allah does not like corrupters
he said i was only given it because of knowledge i have did he not know that allah had destroyed before him of generations those who were greater than him in power and greater in accumulation of wealth but the criminals about their sins will not be asked
so he came out before his people in his adornment those who desired the worldly life said oh would that we had like what was given to qarun indeed he is one of great fortune
but those who had been given knowledge said woe to you the reward of allah is better for he who believes and does righteousness and none are granted it except the patient
and we caused the earth to swallow him and his home and there was for him no company to aid him other than allah nor was he of those who could defend themselves
and those who had wished for his position the previous day began to say oh how allah extends provision to whom he wills of his servants and restricts it if not that allah had conferred favor on us he would have caused it to swallow us oh how the disbelievers do not succeed
that home of the hereafter we assign to those who do not desire exaltedness upon the earth or corruption and the best outcome is for the righteous
whoever comes on the day of judgement with a good deed will have better than it and whoever comes with an evil deed then those who did evil deeds will not be recompensed except as much as what they used to do
indeed o muhammad he who imposed upon you the qur an will take you back to a place of return say my lord is most knowing of who brings guidance and who is in clear error
and you were not expecting that the book would be conveyed to you but it is a mercy from your lord so do not be an assistant to the disbelievers
and never let them avert you from the verses of allah after they have been revealed to you and invite people to your lord and never be of those who associate others with allah
and do not invoke with allah another deity there is no deity except him everything will be destroyed except his face his is the judgement and to him you will be returned
alif lam meem
do the people think that they will be left to say we believe and they will not be tried
but we have certainly tried those before them and allah will surely make evident those who are truthful and he will surely make evident the liars
or do those who do evil deeds think they can outrun us evil is what they judge
whoever should hope for the meeting with allah indeed the term decreed by allah is coming and he is the hearing the knowing
and whoever strives only strives for the benefit of himself indeed allah is free from need of the worlds
and those who believe and do righteous deeds we will surely remove from them their misdeeds and will surely reward them according to the best of what they used to do
and we have enjoined upon man goodness to parents but if they endeavor to make you associate with me that of which you have no knowledge do not obey them to me is your return and i will inform you about what you used to do
and those who believe and do righteous deeds we will surely admit them among the righteous into paradise
and of the people are some who say we believe in allah but when one of them is harmed for the cause of allah they consider the trial of the people as if it were the punishment of allah but if victory comes from your lord they say indeed we were with you is not allah most knowing of what is within the breasts of all creatures
and allah will surely make evident those who believe and he will surely make evident the hypocrites
and those who disbelieve say to those who believe follow our way and we will carry your sins but they will not carry anything of their sins indeed they are liars
but they will surely carry their own burdens and other burdens along with their burdens and they will surely be questioned on the day of resurrection about what they used to invent
and we certainly sent noah to his people and he remained among them a thousand years minus fifty years and the flood seized them while they were wrongdoers
but we saved him and the companions of the ship and we made it a sign for the worlds
and we sent abraham when he said to his people worship allah and fear him that is best for you if you should know
you only worship besides allah idols and you produce a falsehood indeed those you worship besides allah do not possess for you the power of provision so seek from allah provision and worship him and be grateful to him to him you will be returned
and if you people deny the message already nations before you have denied and there is not upon the messenger except the duty of clear notification
have they not considered how allah begins creation and then repeats it indeed that for allah is easy
say o muhammad travel through the land and observe how he began creation then allah will produce the final creation indeed allah over all things is competent
he punishes whom he wills and has mercy upon whom he wills and to him you will be returned
and you will not cause failure to allah upon the earth or in the heaven and you have not other than allah any protector or any helper
and the ones who disbelieve in the signs of allah and the meeting with him those have despaired of my mercy and they will have a painful punishment
and the answer of abraham s people was not but that they said kill him or burn him but allah saved him from the fire indeed in that are signs for a people who believe
and abraham said you have only taken other than allah idols as a bond of affection among you in worldly life then on the day of resurrection you will deny one another and curse one another and your refuge will be the fire and you will not have any helpers
and lot believed him abraham said indeed i will emigrate to the service of my lord indeed he is the exalted in might the wise
and we gave to him isaac and jacob and placed in his descendants prophethood and scripture and we gave him his reward in this world and indeed he is in the hereafter among the righteous
and mention lot when he said to his people indeed you commit such immorality as no one has preceded you with from among the worlds
indeed you approach men and obstruct the road and commit in your meetings every evil and the answer of his people was not but they said bring us the punishment of allah if you should be of the truthful
he said my lord support me against the corrupting people
and when our messengers came to abraham with the good tidings they said indeed we will destroy the people of that lot s city indeed its people have been wrongdoers
abraham said indeed within it is lot they said we are more knowing of who is within it we will surely save him and his family except his wife she is to be of those who remain behind
and when our messengers came to lot he was distressed for them and felt for them great discomfort they said fear not nor grieve indeed we will save you and your family except your wife she is to be of those who remain behind
indeed we will bring down on the people of this city punishment from the sky because they have been defiantly disobedient
and we have certainly left of it a sign as clear evidence for a people who use reason
and to madyan we sent their brother shu ayb and he said o my people worship allah and expect the last day and do not commit abuse on the earth spreading corruption
but they denied him so the earthquake seized them and they became within their home corpses fallen prone
and we destroyed aad and thamud and it has become clear to you from their ruined dwellings and satan had made pleasing to them their deeds and averted them from the path and they were endowed with perception
and we destroyed qarun and pharaoh and haman and moses had already come to them with clear evidences and they were arrogant in the land but they were not outrunners of our punishment
so each we seized for his sin and among them were those upon whom we sent a storm of stones and among them were those who were seized by the blast from the sky and among them were those whom we caused the earth to swallow and among them were those whom we drowned and allah would not have wronged them but it was they who were wronging themselves
the example of those who take allies other than allah is like that of the spider who takes a home and indeed the weakest of homes is the home of the spider if they only knew
indeed allah knows whatever thing they call upon other than him and he is the exalted in might the wise
and these examples we present to the people but none will understand them except those of knowledge
allah created the heavens and the earth in truth indeed in that is a sign for the believers
recite o muhammad what has been revealed to you of the book and establish prayer indeed prayer prohibits immorality and wrongdoing and the remembrance of allah is greater and allah knows that which you do
and do not argue with the people of the scripture except in a way that is best except for those who commit injustice among them and say we believe in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to you and our god and your god is one and we are muslims in submission to him
and thus we have sent down to you the qur an and those to whom we previously gave the scripture believe in it and among these people of makkah are those who believe in it and none reject our verses except the disbelievers
and you did not recite before it any scripture nor did you inscribe one with your right hand otherwise the falsifiers would have had cause for doubt
rather the qur an is distinct verses preserved within the breasts of those who have been given knowledge and none reject our verses except the wrongdoers
but they say why are not signs sent down to him from his lord say the signs are only with allah and i am only a clear warner
and is it not sufficient for them that we revealed to you the book which is recited to them indeed in that is a mercy and reminder for a people who believe
say sufficient is allah between me and you as witness he knows what is in the heavens and earth and they who have believed in falsehood and disbelieved in allah it is those who are the losers
and they urge you to hasten the punishment and if not for the decree of a specified term punishment would have reached them but it will surely come to them suddenly while they perceive not
they urge you to hasten the punishment and indeed hell will be encompassing of the disbelievers
on the day the punishment will cover them from above them and from below their feet and it is said taste the result of what you used to do
o my servants who have believed indeed my earth is spacious so worship only me
every soul will taste death then to us will you be returned
and those who have believed and done righteous deeds we will surely assign to them of paradise elevated chambers beneath which rivers flow wherein they abide eternally excellent is the reward of the righteous workers
who have been patient and upon their lord rely
and how many a creature carries not its own provision allah provides for it and for you and he is the hearing the knowing
if you asked them who created the heavens and earth and subjected the sun and the moon they would surely say allah then how are they deluded
allah extends provision for whom he wills of his servants and restricts for him indeed allah is of all things knowing
and if you asked them who sends down rain from the sky and gives life thereby to the earth after its lifelessness they would surely say allah say praise to allah but most of them do not reason
and this worldly life is not but diversion and amusement and indeed the home of the hereafter that is the eternal life if only they knew
and when they board a ship they supplicate allah sincere to him in religion but when he delivers them to the land at once they associate others with him
so that they will deny what we have granted them and they will enjoy themselves but they are going to know
have they not seen that we made makkah a safe sanctuary while people are being taken away all around them then in falsehood do they believe and in the favor of allah they disbelieve
and who is more unjust than one who invents a lie about allah or denies the truth when it has come to him is there not in hell a sufficient residence for the disbelievers
and those who strive for us we will surely guide them to our ways and indeed allah is with the doers of good
alif lam meem
the byzantines have been defeated
in the nearest land but they after their defeat will overcome
within three to nine years to allah belongs the command before and after and that day the believers will rejoice
in the victory of allah he gives victory to whom he wills and he is the exalted in might the merciful
it is the promise of allah allah does not fail in his promise but most of the people do not know
they know what is apparent of the worldly life but they of the hereafter are unaware
do they not contemplate within themselves allah has not created the heavens and the earth and what is between them except in truth and for a specified term and indeed many of the people in the matter of the meeting with their lord are disbelievers
have they not traveled through the earth and observed how was the end of those before them they were greater than them in power and they plowed the earth and built it up more than they have built it up and their messengers came to them with clear evidences and allah would not ever have wronged them but they were wronging themselves
then the end of those who did evil was the worst consequence because they denied the signs of allah and used to ridicule them
allah begins creation then he will repeat it then to him you will be returned
and the day the hour appears the criminals will be in despair
and there will not be for them among their alleged partners any intercessors and they will then be disbelievers in their partners
and the day the hour appears that day they will become separated
and as for those who had believed and done righteous deeds they will be in a garden of paradise delighted
but as for those who disbelieved and denied our verses and the meeting of the hereafter those will be brought into the punishment to remain
so exalted is allah when you reach the evening and when you reach the morning
and to him is due all praise throughout the heavens and the earth and exalted is he at night and when you are at noon
he brings the living out of the dead and brings the dead out of the living and brings to life the earth after its lifelessness and thus will you be brought out
and of his signs is that he created you from dust then suddenly you were human beings dispersing throughout the earth
and of his signs is that he created for you from yourselves mates that you may find tranquillity in them and he placed between you affection and mercy indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought
and of his signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the diversity of your languages and your colors indeed in that are signs for those of knowledge
and of his signs is your sleep by night and day and your seeking of his bounty indeed in that are signs for a people who listen
and of his signs is that he shows you the lightning causing fear and aspiration and he sends down rain from the sky by which he brings to life the earth after its lifelessness indeed in that are signs for a people who use reason
and of his signs is that the heaven and earth remain by his command then when he calls you with a single call from the earth immediately you will come forth
and to him belongs whoever is in the heavens and earth all are to him devoutly obedient
and it is he who begins creation then he repeats it and that is even easier for him to him belongs the highest attribute in the heavens and earth and he is the exalted in might the wise
he presents to you an example from yourselves do you have among those whom your right hands possess any partners in what we have provided for you so that you are equal therein and would fear them as your fear of one another within a partnership thus do we detail the verses for a people who use reason
but those who wrong follow their own desires without knowledge then who can guide one whom allah has sent astray and for them there are no helpers
so direct your face toward the religion inclining to truth adhere to the fitrah of allah upon which he has created all people no change should there be in the creation of allah that is the correct religion but most of the people do not know
adhere to it turning in repentance to him and fear him and establish prayer and do not be of those who associate others with allah
or of those who have divided their religion and become sects every faction rejoicing in what it has
and when adversity touches the people they call upon their lord turning in repentance to him then when he lets them taste mercy from him at once a party of them associate others with their lord
so that they will deny what we have granted them then enjoy yourselves for you are going to know
or have we sent down to them an authority and it speaks of what they were associating with him
and when we let the people taste mercy they rejoice therein but if evil afflicts them for what their hands have put forth immediately they despair
do they not see that allah extends provision for whom he wills and restricts it indeed in that are signs for a people who believe
so give the relative his right as well as the needy and the traveler that is best for those who desire the countenance of allah and it is they who will be the successful
and whatever you give for interest to increase within the wealth of people will not increase with allah but what you give in zakah desiring the countenance of allah those are the multipliers
allah is the one who created you then provided for you then will cause you to die and then will give you life are there any of your partners who does anything of that exalted is he and high above what they associate with him
corruption has appeared throughout the land and sea by reason of what the hands of people have earned so he may let them taste part of the consequence of what they have done that perhaps they will return to righteousness
say o muhammad travel through the land and observe how was the end of those before most of them were associators of others with allah
so direct your face toward the correct religion before a day comes from allah of which there is no repelling that day they will be divided
whoever disbelieves upon him is the consequence of his disbelief and whoever does righteousness they are for themselves preparing
that he may reward those who have believed and done righteous deeds out of his bounty indeed he does not like the disbelievers
and of his signs is that he sends the winds as bringers of good tidings and to let you taste his mercy and so the ships may sail at his command and so you may seek of his bounty and perhaps you will be grateful
and we have already sent messengers before you to their peoples and they came to them with clear evidences then we took retribution from those who committed crimes and incumbent upon us was support of the believers
it is allah who sends the winds and they stir the clouds and spread them in the sky however he wills and he makes them fragments so you see the rain emerge from within them and when he causes it to fall upon whom he wills of his servants immediately they rejoice
although they were before it was sent down upon them before that in despair
so observe the effects of the mercy of allah how he gives life to the earth after its lifelessness indeed that same one will give life to the dead and he is over all things competent
but if we should send a bad wind and they saw their crops turned yellow they would remain thereafter disbelievers
so indeed you will not make the dead hear nor will you make the deaf hear the call when they turn their backs retreating
and you cannot guide the blind away from their error you will only make hear those who believe in our verses so they are muslims in submission to allah
allah is the one who created you from weakness then made after weakness strength then made after strength weakness and white hair he creates what he wills and he is the knowing the competent
and the day the hour appears the criminals will swear they had remained but an hour thus they were deluded
but those who were given knowledge and faith will say you remained the extent of allah s decree until the day of resurrection and this is the day of resurrection but you did not used to know
so that day their excuse will not benefit those who wronged nor will they be asked to appease allah
and we have certainly presented to the people in this qur an from every kind of example but o muhammad if you should bring them a sign the disbelievers will surely say you believers are but falsifiers
thus does allah seal the hearts of those who do not know
so be patient indeed the promise of allah is truth and let them not disquiet you who are not certain in faith
alif lam meem
these are verses of the wise book
as guidance and mercy for the doers of good
who establish prayer and give zakah and they of the hereafter are certain in faith
those are on right guidance from their lord and it is those who are the successful
and of the people is he who buys the amusement of speech to mislead others from the way of allah without knowledge and who takes it in ridicule those will have a humiliating punishment
and when our verses are recited to him he turns away arrogantly as if he had not heard them as if there was in his ears deafness so give him tidings of a painful punishment
indeed those who believe and do righteous deeds for them are the gardens of pleasure
wherein they abide eternally it is the promise of allah which is truth and he is the exalted in might the wise
he created the heavens without pillars that you see and has cast into the earth firmly set mountains lest it should shift with you and dispersed therein from every creature and we sent down rain from the sky and made grow therein plants of every noble kind
this is the creation of allah so show me what those other than him have created rather the wrongdoers are in clear error
and we had certainly given luqman wisdom and said be grateful to allah and whoever is grateful is grateful for the benefit of himself and whoever denies his favor then indeed allah is free of need and praiseworthy
and mention o muhammad when luqman said to his son while he was instructing him o my son do not associate anything with allah indeed association with him is great injustice
and we have enjoined upon man care for his parents his mother carried him increasing her in weakness upon weakness and his weaning is in two years be grateful to me and to your parents to me is the final destination
but if they endeavor to make you associate with me that of which you have no knowledge do not obey them but accompany them in this world with appropriate kindness and follow the way of those who turn back to me in repentance then to me will be your return and i will inform you about what you used to do
and luqman said o my son indeed if wrong should be the weight of a mustard seed and should be within a rock or anywhere in the heavens or in the earth allah will bring it forth indeed allah is subtle and acquainted
o my son establish prayer enjoin what is right forbid what is wrong and be patient over what befalls you indeed all that is of the matters requiring determination
and do not turn your cheek in contempt toward people and do not walk through the earth exultantly indeed allah does not like everyone self deluded and boastful
and be moderate in your pace and lower your voice indeed the most disagreeable of sounds is the voice of donkeys
do you not see that allah has made subject to you whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth and amply bestowed upon you his favors both apparent and unapparent but of the people is he who disputes about allah without knowledge or guidance or an enlightening book from him
and when it is said to them follow what allah has revealed they say rather we will follow that upon which we found our fathers even if satan was inviting them to the punishment of the blaze
and whoever submits his face to allah while he is a doer of good then he has grasped the most trustworthy handhold and to allah will be the outcome of all matters
and whoever has disbelieved let not his disbelief grieve you to us is their return and we will inform them of what they did indeed allah is knowing of that within the breasts
we grant them enjoyment for a little then we will force them to a massive punishment
and if you asked them who created the heavens and earth they would surely say allah say all praise is due to allah but most of them do not know
to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and earth indeed allah is the free of need the praiseworthy
and if whatever trees upon the earth were pens and the sea was ink replenished thereafter by seven more seas the words of allah would not be exhausted indeed allah is exalted in might and wise
your creation and your resurrection will not be but as that of a single soul indeed allah is hearing and seeing
do you not see that allah causes the night to enter the day and causes the day to enter the night and has subjected the sun and the moon each running its course for a specified term and that allah with whatever you do is acquainted
that is because allah is the truth and that what they call upon other than him is falsehood and because allah is the most high the grand
do you not see that ships sail through the sea by the favor of allah that he may show you of his signs indeed in that are signs for everyone patient and grateful
and when waves come over them like canopies they supplicate allah sincere to him in religion but when he delivers them to the land there are some of them who are moderate in faith and none rejects our signs except everyone treacherous and ungrateful
o mankind fear your lord and fear a day when no father will avail his son nor will a son avail his father at all indeed the promise of allah is truth so let not the worldly life delude you and be not deceived about allah by the deceiver
indeed allah alone has knowledge of the hour and sends down the rain and knows what is in the wombs and no soul perceives what it will earn tomorrow and no soul perceives in what land it will die indeed allah is knowing and acquainted
alif lam meem
this is the revelation of the book about which there is no doubt from the lord of the worlds
or do they say he invented it rather it is the truth from your lord o muhammad that you may warn a people to whom no warner has come before you so perhaps they will be guided
it is allah who created the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them in six days then he established himself above the throne you have not besides him any protector or any intercessor so will you not be reminded
he arranges each matter from the heaven to the earth then it will ascend to him in a day the extent of which is a thousand years of those which you count
that is the knower of the unseen and the witnessed the exalted in might the merciful
who perfected everything which he created and began the creation of man from clay
then he made his posterity out of the extract of a liquid disdained
then he proportioned him and breathed into him from his created soul and made for you hearing and vision and hearts little are you grateful
and they say when we are lost within the earth will we indeed be recreated in a new creation rather they are in the matter of the meeting with their lord disbelievers
say the angel of death will take you who has been entrusted with you then to your lord you will be returned
if you could but see when the criminals are hanging their heads before their lord saying our lord we have seen and heard so return us to the world we will work righteousness indeed we are now certain
and if we had willed we could have given every soul its guidance but the word from me will come into effect that i will surely fill hell with jinn and people all together
so taste punishment because you forgot the meeting of this your day indeed we have accordingly forgotten you and taste the punishment of eternity for what you used to do
only those believe in our verses who when they are reminded by them fall down in prostration and exalt allah with praise of their lord and they are not arrogant
they arise from their beds they supplicate their lord in fear and aspiration and from what we have provided them they spend
and no soul knows what has been hidden for them of comfort for eyes as reward for what they used to do
then is one who was a believer like one who was defiantly disobedient they are not equal
as for those who believed and did righteous deeds for them will be the gardens of refuge as accommodation for what they used to do
but as for those who defiantly disobeyed their refuge is the fire every time they wish to emerge from it they will be returned to it while it is said to them taste the punishment of the fire which you used to deny
and we will surely let them taste the nearer punishment short of the greater punishment that perhaps they will repent
and who is more unjust than one who is reminded of the verses of his lord then he turns away from them indeed we from the criminals will take retribution
and we certainly gave moses the scripture so do not be in doubt over his meeting and we made the torah guidance for the children of israel
and we made from among them leaders guiding by our command when they were patient and when they were certain of our signs
indeed your lord will judge between them on the day of resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ
has it not become clear to them how many generations we destroyed before them as they walk among their dwellings indeed in that are signs then do they not hear
have they not seen that we drive the water in clouds to barren land and bring forth thereby crops from which their livestock eat and they themselves then do they not see
and they say when will be this conquest if you should be truthful
say o muhammad on the day of conquest the belief of those who had disbelieved will not benefit them nor will they be reprieved
so turn away from them and wait indeed they are waiting
o prophet fear allah and do not obey the disbelievers and the hypocrites indeed allah is ever knowing and wise
and follow that which is revealed to you from your lord indeed allah is ever with what you do acquainted
and rely upon allah and sufficient is allah as disposer of affairs
allah has not made for a man two hearts in his interior and he has not made your wives whom you declare unlawful your mothers and he has not made your adopted sons your true sons that is merely your saying by your mouths but allah says the truth and he guides to the right way
call them by the names of their fathers it is more just in the sight of allah but if you do not know their fathers then they are still your brothers in religion and those entrusted to you and there is no blame upon you for that in which you have erred but only for what your hearts intended and ever is allah forgiving and merciful
the prophet is more worthy of the believers than themselves and his wives are in the position of their mothers and those of blood relationship are more entitled to inheritance in the decree of allah than the other believers and the emigrants except that you may do to your close associates a kindness through bequest that was in the book inscribed
and mention o muhammad when we took from the prophets their covenant and from you and from noah and abraham and moses and jesus the son of mary and we took from them a solemn covenant
that he may question the truthful about their truth and he has prepared for the disbelievers a painful punishment
o you who have believed remember the favor of allah upon you when armies came to attack you and we sent upon them a wind and armies of angels you did not see and ever is allah of what you do seeing
remember when they came at you from above you and from below you and when eyes shifted in fear and hearts reached the throats and you assumed about allah various assumptions
there the believers were tested and shaken with a severe shaking
and remember when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is disease said allah and his messenger did not promise us except delusion
and when a faction of them said o people of yathrib there is no stability for you here so return home and a party of them asked permission of the prophet saying indeed our houses are unprotected while they were not exposed they did not intend except to flee
and if they had been entered upon from all its surrounding regions and fitnah had been demanded of them they would have done it and not hesitated over it except briefly
and they had already promised allah before not to turn their backs and flee and ever is the promise to allah that about which one will be questioned
say o muhammad never will fleeing benefit you if you should flee from death or killing and then if you did you would not be given enjoyment of life except for a little
say who is it that can protect you from allah if he intends for you an ill or intends for you a mercy and they will not find for themselves besides allah any protector or any helper
already allah knows the hinderers among you and those hypocrites who say to their brothers come to us and do not go to battle except for a few
indisposed toward you and when fear comes you see them looking at you their eyes revolving like one being overcome by death but when fear departs they lash you with sharp tongues indisposed toward any good those have not believed so allah has rendered their deeds worthless and ever is that for allah easy
they think the companies have not yet withdrawn and if the companies should come again they would wish they were in the desert among the bedouins inquiring from afar about your news and if they should be among you they would not fight except for a little
there has certainly been for you in the messenger of allah an excellent pattern for anyone whose hope is in allah and the last day and who remembers allah often
and when the believers saw the companies they said this is what allah and his messenger had promised us and allah and his messenger spoke the truth and it increased them only in faith and acceptance
among the believers are men true to what they promised allah among them is he who has fulfilled his vow to the death and among them is he who awaits his chance and they did not alter the terms of their commitment by any alteration
that allah may reward the truthful for their truth and punish the hypocrites if he wills or accept their repentance indeed allah is ever forgiving and merciful
and allah repelled those who disbelieved in their rage not having obtained any good and sufficient was allah for the believers in battle and ever is allah powerful and exalted in might
and he brought down those who supported them among the people of the scripture from their fortresses and cast terror into their hearts so that a party you killed and you took captive a party
and he caused you to inherit their land and their homes and their properties and a land which you have not trodden and ever is allah over all things competent
o prophet say to your wives if you should desire the worldly life and its adornment then come i will provide for you and give you a gracious release
but if you should desire allah and his messenger and the home of the hereafter then indeed allah has prepared for the doers of good among you a great reward
o wives of the prophet whoever of you should commit a clear immorality for her the punishment would be doubled two fold and ever is that for allah easy
and whoever of you devoutly obeys allah and his messenger and does righteousness we will give her her reward twice and we have prepared for her a noble provision
o wives of the prophet you are not like anyone among women if you fear allah then do not be soft in speech to men lest he in whose heart is disease should covet but speak with appropriate speech
and abide in your houses and do not display yourselves as was the display of the former times of ignorance and establish prayer and give zakah and obey allah and his messenger allah intends only to remove from you the impurity of sin o people of the prophet s household and to purify you with extensive purification
and remember what is recited in your houses of the verses of allah and wisdom indeed allah is ever subtle and acquainted with all things
indeed the muslim men and muslim women the believing men and believing women the obedient men and obedient women the truthful men and truthful women the patient men and patient women the humble men and humble women the charitable men and charitable women the fasting men and fasting women the men who guard their private parts and the women who do so and the men who remember allah often and the women who do so for them allah has prepared forgiveness and a great reward
it is not for a believing man or a believing woman when allah and his messenger have decided a matter that they should thereafter have any choice about their affair and whoever disobeys allah and his messenger has certainly strayed into clear error
and remember o muhammad when you said to the one on whom allah bestowed favor and you bestowed favor keep your wife and fear allah while you concealed within yourself that which allah is to disclose and you feared the people while allah has more right that you fear him so when zayd had no longer any need for her we married her to you in order that there not be upon the believers any discomfort concerning the wives of their adopted sons when they no longer have need of them and ever is the command of allah accomplished
there is not to be upon the prophet any discomfort concerning that which allah has imposed upon him this is the established way of allah with those prophets who have passed on before and ever is the command of allah a destiny decreed
allah praises those who convey the messages of allah and fear him and do not fear anyone but allah and sufficient is allah as accountant
muhammad is not the father of any one of your men but he is the messenger of allah and last of the prophets and ever is allah of all things knowing
o you who have believed remember allah with much remembrance
and exalt him morning and afternoon
it is he who confers blessing upon you and his angels ask him to do so that he may bring you out from darknesses into the light and ever is he to the believers merciful
their greeting the day they meet him will be peace and he has prepared for them a noble reward
o prophet indeed we have sent you as a witness and a bringer of good tidings and a warner
and one who invites to allah by his permission and an illuminating lamp
and give good tidings to the believers that they will have from allah great bounty
and do not obey the disbelievers and the hypocrites but do not harm them and rely upon allah and sufficient is allah as disposer of affairs
o you who have believed when you marry believing women and then divorce them before you have touched them then there is not for you any waiting period to count concerning them so provide for them and give them a gracious release
o prophet indeed we have made lawful to you your wives to whom you have given their due compensation and those your right hand possesses from what allah has returned to you of captives and the daughters of your paternal uncles and the daughters of your paternal aunts and the daughters of your maternal uncles and the daughters of your maternal aunts who emigrated with you and a believing woman if she gives herself to the prophet and if the prophet wishes to marry her this is only for you excluding the other believers we certainly know what we have made obligatory upon them concerning their wives and those their right hands possess but this is for you in order that there will be upon you no discomfort and ever is allah forgiving and merciful
you o muhammad may put aside whom you will of them or take to yourself whom you will and any that you desire of those wives from whom you had temporarily separated there is no blame upon you in returning her that is more suitable that they should be content and not grieve and that they should be satisfied with what you have given them all of them and allah knows what is in your hearts and ever is allah knowing and forbearing
not lawful to you o muhammad are any additional women after this nor is it for you to exchange them for other wives even if their beauty were to please you except what your right hand possesses and ever is allah over all things an observer
o you who have believed do not enter the houses of the prophet except when you are permitted for a meal without awaiting its readiness but when you are invited then enter and when you have eaten disperse without seeking to remain for conversation indeed that behavior was troubling the prophet and he is shy of dismissing you but allah is not shy of the truth and when you ask his wives for something ask them from behind a partition that is purer for your hearts and their hearts and it is not conceivable or lawful for you to harm the messenger of allah or to marry his wives after him ever indeed that would be in the sight of allah an enormity
whether you reveal a thing or conceal it indeed allah is ever of all things knowing
there is no blame upon women concerning their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their brothers sons or their sisters sons or their women or those their right hands possess and fear allah indeed allah is ever over all things witness
indeed allah confers blessing upon the prophet and his angels ask him to do so o you who have believed ask allah to confer blessing upon him and ask allah to grant him peace
indeed those who abuse allah and his messenger allah has cursed them in this world and the hereafter and prepared for them a humiliating punishment
and those who harm believing men and believing women for something other than what they have earned have certainly born upon themselves a slander and manifest sin
o prophet tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to bring down over themselves part of their outer garments that is more suitable that they will be known and not be abused and ever is allah forgiving and merciful
if the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is disease and those who spread rumors in al madinah do not cease we will surely incite you against them then they will not remain your neighbors therein except for a little
accursed wherever they are found being seized and massacred completely
this is the established way of allah with those who passed on before and you will not find in the way of allah any change
people ask you concerning the hour say knowledge of it is only with allah and what may make you perceive perhaps the hour is near
indeed allah has cursed the disbelievers and prepared for them a blaze
abiding therein forever they will not find a protector or a helper
the day their faces will be turned about in the fire they will say how we wish we had obeyed allah and obeyed the messenger
and they will say our lord indeed we obeyed our masters and our dignitaries and they led us astray from the right way
our lord give them double the punishment and curse them with a great curse
o you who have believed be not like those who abused moses then allah cleared him of what they said and he in the sight of allah was distinguished
o you who have believed fear allah and speak words of appropriate justice
he will then amend for you your deeds and forgive you your sins and whoever obeys allah and his messenger has certainly attained a great attainment
indeed we offered the trust to the heavens and the earth and the mountains and they declined to bear it and feared it but man undertook to bear it indeed he was unjust and ignorant
it was so that allah may punish the hypocrite men and hypocrite women and the men and women who associate others with him and that allah may accept repentance from the believing men and believing women and ever is allah forgiving and merciful
all praise is due to allah to whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth and to him belongs all praise in the hereafter and he is the wise the acquainted
he knows what penetrates into the earth and what emerges from it and what descends from the heaven and what ascends therein and he is the merciful the forgiving
but those who disbelieve say the hour will not come to us say yes by my lord it will surely come to you allah is the knower of the unseen not absent from him is an atom s weight within the heavens or within the earth or what is smaller than that or greater except that it is in a clear register
that he may reward those who believe and do righteous deeds those will have forgiveness and noble provision
but those who strive against our verses seeking to cause failure for them will be a painful punishment of foul nature
and those who have been given knowledge see that what is revealed to you from your lord is the truth and it guides to the path of the exalted in might the praiseworthy
but those who disbelieve say shall we direct you to a man who will inform you that when you have disintegrated in complete disintegration you will then be recreated in a new creation
has he invented about allah a lie or is there in him madness rather they who do not believe in the hereafter will be in the punishment and are in extreme error
then do they not look at what is before them and what is behind them of the heaven and earth if we should will we could cause the earth to swallow them or could let fall upon them fragments from the sky indeed in that is a sign for every servant turning back to allah
and we certainly gave david from us bounty we said o mountains repeat our praises with him and the birds as well and we made pliable for him iron
commanding him make full coats of mail and calculate precisely the links and work all of you righteousness indeed i of what you do am seeing
and to solomon we subjected the wind its morning journey was that of a month and its afternoon journey was that of a month and we made flow for him a spring of liquid copper and among the jinn were those who worked for him by the permission of his lord and whoever deviated among them from our command we will make him taste of the punishment of the blaze
they made for him what he willed of elevated chambers statues bowls like reservoirs and stationary kettles we said work o family of david in gratitude and few of my servants are grateful
and when we decreed for solomon death nothing indicated to the jinn his death except a creature of the earth eating his staff but when he fell it became clear to the jinn that if they had known the unseen they would not have remained in humiliating punishment
there was for the tribe of saba in their dwelling place a sign two fields of gardens on the right and on the left they were told eat from the provisions of your lord and be grateful to him a good land have you and a forgiving lord
but they turned away refusing so we sent upon them the flood of the dam and we replaced their two fields of gardens with gardens of bitter fruit tamarisks and something of sparse lote trees
by that we repaid them because they disbelieved and do we thus repay except the ungrateful
and we placed between them and the cities which we had blessed many visible cities and we determined between them the distances of journey saying travel between them by night or day in safety
but insolently they said our lord lengthen the distance between our journeys and wronged themselves so we made them narrations and dispersed them in total dispersion indeed in that are signs for everyone patient and grateful
and iblees had already confirmed through them his assumption so they followed him except for a party of believers
and he had over them no authority except it was decreed that we might make evident who believes in the hereafter from who is thereof in doubt and your lord over all things is guardian
say o muhammad invoke those you claim as deities besides allah they do not possess an atom s weight of ability in the heavens or on the earth and they do not have therein any partnership with him nor is there for him from among them any assistant
and intercession does not benefit with him except for one whom he permits and those wait until when terror is removed from their hearts they will say to one another what has your lord said they will say the truth and he is the most high the grand
say who provides for you from the heavens and the earth say allah and indeed we or you are either upon guidance or in clear error
say you will not be asked about what we committed and we will not be asked about what you do
say our lord will bring us together then he will judge between us in truth and he is the knowing judge
say show me those whom you have attached to him as partners no rather he alone is allah the exalted in might the wise
and we have not sent you except comprehensively to mankind as a bringer of good tidings and a warner but most of the people do not know
and they say when is this promise if you should be truthful
say for you is the appointment of a day when you will not remain thereafter an hour nor will you precede it
and those who disbelieve say we will never believe in this qur an nor in that before it but if you could see when the wrongdoers are made to stand before their lord refuting each other s words those who were oppressed will say to those who were arrogant if not for you we would have been believers
those who were arrogant will say to those who were oppressed did we avert you from guidance after it had come to you rather you were criminals
those who were oppressed will say to those who were arrogant rather it was your conspiracy of night and day when you were ordering us to disbelieve in allah and attribute to him equals but they will all confide regret when they see the punishment and we will put shackles on the necks of those who disbelieved will they be recompensed except for what they used to do
and we did not send into a city any warner except that its affluent said indeed we in that with which you were sent are disbelievers
and they said we are more than the believers in wealth and children and we are not to be punished
say indeed my lord extends provision for whom he wills and restricts it but most of the people do not know
and it is not your wealth or your children that bring you nearer to us in position but it is by being one who has believed and done righteousness for them there will be the double reward for what they did and they will be in the upper chambers of paradise safe and secure
and the ones who strive against our verses to cause them failure those will be brought into the punishment to remain
say indeed my lord extends provision for whom he wills of his servants and restricts it for him but whatever thing you spend in his cause he will compensate it and he is the best of providers
and mention the day when he will gather them all and then say to the angels did these people used to worship you
they will say exalted are you you o allah are our benefactor not them rather they used to worship the jinn most of them were believers in them
but today you do not hold for one another the power of benefit or harm and we will say to those who wronged taste the punishment of the fire which you used to deny
and when our verses are recited to them as clear evidences they say this is not but a man who wishes to avert you from that which your fathers were worshipping and they say this is not except a lie invented and those who disbelieve say of the truth when it has come to them this is not but obvious magic
and we had not given them any scriptures which they could study and we had not sent to them before you o muhammad any warner
and those before them denied and the people of makkah have not attained a tenth of what we had given them but the former peoples denied my messengers so how terrible was my reproach
say i only advise you of one thing that you stand for allah seeking truth in pairs and individually and then give thought there is not in your companion any madness he is only a warner to you before a severe punishment
say whatever payment i might have asked of you it is yours my payment is only from allah and he is over all things witness
say indeed my lord projects the truth knower of the unseen
say the truth has come and falsehood can neither begin anything nor repeat it
say if i should err i would only err against myself but if i am guided it is by what my lord reveals to me indeed he is hearing and near
and if you could see when they are terrified but there is no escape and they will be seized from a place nearby
and they will then say we believe in it but how for them will be the taking of faith from a place far away
and they had already disbelieved in it before and would assault the unseen from a place far away
and prevention will be placed between them and what they desire as was done with their kind before indeed they were in disquieting denial
all praise is due to allah creator of the heavens and the earth who made the angels messengers having wings two or three or four he increases in creation what he wills indeed allah is over all things competent
whatever allah grants to people of mercy none can withhold it and whatever he withholds none can release it thereafter and he is the exalted in might the wise
o mankind remember the favor of allah upon you is there any creator other than allah who provides for you from the heaven and earth there is no deity except him so how are you deluded
and if they deny you o muhammad already were messengers denied before you and to allah are returned all matters
o mankind indeed the promise of allah is truth so let not the worldly life delude you and be not deceived about allah by the deceiver
indeed satan is an enemy to you so take him as an enemy he only invites his party to be among the companions of the blaze
those who disbelieve will have a severe punishment and those who believe and do righteous deeds will have forgiveness and great reward
then is one to whom the evil of his deed has been made attractive so he considers it good like one rightly guided for indeed allah sends astray whom he wills and guides whom he wills so do not let yourself perish over them in regret indeed allah is knowing of what they do
and it is allah who sends the winds and they stir the clouds and we drive them to a dead land and give life thereby to the earth after its lifelessness thus is the resurrection
whoever desires honor through power then to allah belongs all honor to him ascends good speech and righteous work raises it but they who plot evil deeds will have a severe punishment and the plotting of those it will perish
and allah created you from dust then from a sperm drop then he made you mates and no female conceives nor does she give birth except with his knowledge and no aged person is granted additional life nor is his lifespan lessened but that it is in a register indeed that for allah is easy
and not alike are the two bodies of water one is fresh and sweet palatable for drinking and one is salty and bitter and from each you eat tender meat and extract ornaments which you wear and you see the ships plowing through them that you might seek of his bounty and perhaps you will be grateful
he causes the night to enter the day and he causes the day to enter the night and has subjected the sun and the moon each running its course for a specified term that is allah your lord to him belongs sovereignty and those whom you invoke other than him do not possess as much as the membrane of a date seed
if you invoke them they do not hear your supplication and if they heard they would not respond to you and on the day of resurrection they will deny your association and none can inform you like one acquainted with all matters
o mankind you are those in need of allah while allah is the free of need the praiseworthy
if he wills he can do away with you and bring forth a new creation
and that is for allah not difficult
and no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another and if a heavily laden soul calls another to carry some of its load nothing of it will be carried even if he should be a close relative you can only warn those who fear their lord unseen and have established prayer and whoever purifies himself only purifies himself for the benefit of his soul and to allah is the final destination
not equal are the blind and the seeing
nor are the darknesses and the light
nor are the shade and the heat
and not equal are the living and the dead indeed allah causes to hear whom he wills but you cannot make hear those in the graves
you o muhammad are not but a warner
indeed we have sent you with the truth as a bringer of good tidings and a warner and there was no nation but that there had passed within it a warner
and if they deny you then already have those before them denied their messengers came to them with clear proofs and written ordinances and with the enlightening scripture
then i seized the ones who disbelieved and how terrible was my reproach
do you not see that allah sends down rain from the sky and we produce thereby fruits of varying colors and in the mountains are tracts white and red of varying shades and some extremely black
and among people and moving creatures and grazing livestock are various colors similarly only those fear allah from among his servants who have knowledge indeed allah is exalted in might and forgiving
indeed those who recite the book of allah and establish prayer and spend in his cause out of what we have provided them secretly and publicly can expect a profit that will never perish
that he may give them in full their rewards and increase for them of his bounty indeed he is forgiving and appreciative
and that which we have revealed to you o muhammad of the book is the truth confirming what was before it indeed allah of his servants is acquainted and seeing
then we caused to inherit the book those we have chosen of our servants and among them is he who wrongs himself and among them is he who is moderate and among them is he who is foremost in good deeds by permission of allah that inheritance is what is the great bounty
for them are gardens of perpetual residence which they will enter they will be adorned therein with bracelets of gold and pearls and their garments therein will be silk
and they will say praise to allah who has removed from us all sorrow indeed our lord is forgiving and appreciative
he who has settled us in the home of duration out of his bounty there touches us not in it any fatigue and there touches us not in it weariness of mind
and for those who disbelieve will be the fire of hell death is not decreed for them so they may die nor will its torment be lightened for them thus do we recompense every ungrateful one
and they will cry out therein our lord remove us we will do righteousness other than what we were doing but did we not grant you life enough for whoever would remember therein to remember and the warner had come to you so taste the punishment for there is not for the wrongdoers any helper
indeed allah is knower of the unseen aspects of the heavens and earth indeed he is knowing of that within the breasts
it is he who has made you successors upon the earth and whoever disbelieves upon him will be the consequence of his disbelief and the disbelief of the disbelievers does not increase them in the sight of their lord except in hatred and the disbelief of the disbelievers does not increase them except in loss
say have you considered your partners whom you invoke besides allah show me what they have created from the earth or have they partnership with him in the heavens or have we given them a book so they are standing on evidence therefrom no rather the wrongdoers do not promise each other except delusion
indeed allah holds the heavens and the earth lest they cease and if they should cease no one could hold them in place after him indeed he is forbearing and forgiving
and they swore by allah their strongest oaths that if a warner came to them they would be more guided than any one of the previous nations but when a warner came to them it did not increase them except in aversion
due to arrogance in the land and plotting of evil but the evil plot does not encompass except its own people then do they await except the way of the former peoples but you will never find in the way of allah any change and you will never find in the way of allah any alteration
have they not traveled through the land and observed how was the end of those before them and they were greater than them in power but allah is not to be caused failure by anything in the heavens or on the earth indeed he is ever knowing and competent
and if allah were to impose blame on the people for what they have earned he would not leave upon the earth any creature but he defers them for a specified term and when their time comes then indeed allah has ever been of his servants seeing
ya seen
by the wise qur an
indeed you o muhammad are from among the messengers
on a straight path
this is a revelation of the exalted in might the merciful
that you may warn a people whose forefathers were not warned so they are unaware
already the word has come into effect upon most of them so they do not believe
indeed we have put shackles on their necks and they are to their chins so they are with heads kept aloft
and we have put before them a barrier and behind them a barrier and covered them so they do not see
and it is all the same for them whether you warn them or do not warn them they will not believe
you can only warn one who follows the message and fears the most merciful unseen so give him good tidings of forgiveness and noble reward
indeed it is we who bring the dead to life and record what they have put forth and what they left behind and all things we have enumerated in a clear register
and present to them an example the people of the city when the messengers came to it
when we sent to them two but they denied them so we strengthened them with a third and they said indeed we are messengers to you
they said you are not but human beings like us and the most merciful has not revealed a thing you are only telling lies
they said our lord knows that we are messengers to you
and we are not responsible except for clear notification
they said indeed we consider you a bad omen if you do not desist we will surely stone you and there will surely touch you from us a painful punishment
they said your omen is with yourselves is it because you were reminded rather you are a transgressing people
and there came from the farthest end of the city a man running he said o my people follow the messengers
follow those who do not ask of you any payment and they are rightly guided
and why should i not worship he who created me and to whom you will be returned
should i take other than him false deities while if the most merciful intends for me some adversity their intercession will not avail me at all nor can they save me
indeed i would then be in manifest error
indeed i have believed in your lord so listen to me
it was said enter paradise he said i wish my people could know
of how my lord has forgiven me and placed me among the honored
and we did not send down upon his people after him any soldiers from the heaven nor would we have done so
it was not but one shout and immediately they were extinguished
how regretful for the servants there did not come to them any messenger except that they used to ridicule him
have they not considered how many generations we destroyed before them that they to them will not return
and indeed all of them will yet be brought present before us
and a sign for them is the dead earth we have brought it to life and brought forth from it grain and from it they eat
and we placed therein gardens of palm trees and grapevines and caused to burst forth therefrom some springs
that they may eat of his fruit and their hands have not produced it so will they not be grateful
exalted is he who created all pairs from what the earth grows and from themselves and from that which they do not know
and a sign for them is the night we remove from it the light of day so they are left in darkness
and the sun runs on course toward its stopping point that is the determination of the exalted in might the knowing
and the moon we have determined for it phases until it returns appearing like the old date stalk
it is not allowable for the sun to reach the moon nor does the night overtake the day but each in an orbit is swimming
and a sign for them is that we carried their forefathers in a laden ship
and we created for them from the likes of it that which they ride
and if we should will we could drown them then no one responding to a cry would there be for them nor would they be saved
except as a mercy from us and provision for a time
but when it is said to them beware of what is before you and what is behind you perhaps you will receive mercy
and no sign comes to them from the signs of their lord except that they are from it turning away
and when it is said to them spend from that which allah has provided for you those who disbelieve say to those who believe should we feed one whom if allah had willed he would have fed you are not but in clear error
and they say when is this promise if you should be truthful
they do not await except one blast which will seize them while they are disputing
and they will not be able to give any instruction nor to their people can they return
and the horn will be blown and at once from the graves to their lord they will hasten
they will say o woe to us who has raised us up from our sleeping place the reply will be this is what the most merciful had promised and the messengers told the truth
it will not be but one blast and at once they are all brought present before us
so today no soul will be wronged at all and you will not be recompensed except for what you used to do
indeed the companions of paradise that day will be amused in joyful occupation
they and their spouses in shade reclining on adorned couches
for them therein is fruit and for them is whatever they request or wish
and peace a word from a merciful lord
then he will say but stand apart today you criminals
did i not enjoin upon you o children of adam that you not worship satan for indeed he is to you a clear enemy
and that you worship only me this is a straight path
and he had already led astray from among you much of creation so did you not use reason
this is the hellfire which you were promised
enter to burn therein today for what you used to deny
that day we will seal over their mouths and their hands will speak to us and their feet will testify about what they used to earn
and if we willed we could have obliterated their eyes and they would race to find the path and how could they see
and if we willed we could have deformed them paralyzing them in their places so they would not be able to proceed nor could they return
and he to whom we grant long life we reverse in creation so will they not understand
and we did not give prophet muhammad knowledge of poetry nor is it befitting for him it is not but a message and a clear qur an
to warn whoever is alive and justify the word against the disbelievers
do they not see that we have created for them from what our hands have made grazing livestock and then they are their owners
and we have tamed them for them so some of them they ride and some of them they eat
and for them therein are other benefits and drinks so will they not be grateful
but they have taken besides allah false deities that perhaps they would be helped
they are not able to help them and they themselves are for them soldiers in attendance
so let not their speech grieve you indeed we know what they conceal and what they declare
does man not consider that we created him from a mere sperm drop then at once he is a clear adversary
and he presents for us an example and forgets his own creation he says who will give life to bones while they are disintegrated
say he will give them life who produced them the first time and he is of all creation knowing
it is he who made for you from the green tree fire and then from it you ignite
is not he who created the heavens and the earth able to create the likes of them yes it is so and he is the knowing creator
his command is only when he intends a thing that he says to it be and it is
so exalted is he in whose hand is the realm of all things and to him you will be returned
by those angels lined up in rows
and those who drive the clouds
and those who recite the message
indeed your god is one
lord of the heavens and the earth and that between them and lord of the sunrises
indeed we have adorned the nearest heaven with an adornment of stars
and as protection against every rebellious devil
so they may not listen to the exalted assembly of angels and are pelted from every side
repelled and for them is a constant punishment
except one who snatches some words by theft but they are pursued by a burning flame piercing in brightness
then inquire of them o muhammad are they a stronger or more difficult creation or those others we have created indeed we created men from sticky clay
but you wonder while they mock
and when they are reminded they remember not
and when they see a sign they ridicule
and say this is not but obvious magic
when we have died and become dust and bones are we indeed to be resurrected
and our forefathers as well
say yes and you will be rendered contemptible
it will be only one shout and at once they will be observing
they will say o woe to us this is the day of recompense
they will be told this is the day of judgement which you used to deny
the angels will be ordered gather those who committed wrong their kinds and what they used to worship
other than allah and guide them to the path of hellfire
and stop them indeed they are to be questioned
they will be asked what is wrong with you why do you not help each other
but they that day are in surrender
and they will approach one another blaming each other
they will say indeed you used to come at us from the right
the oppressors will say rather you yourselves were not believers
and we had over you no authority but you were a transgressing people
so the word of our lord has come into effect upon us indeed we will taste punishment
and we led you to deviation indeed we were deviators
so indeed they that day will be sharing in the punishment
indeed that is how we deal with the criminals
indeed they when it was said to them there is no deity but allah were arrogant
and were saying are we to leave our gods for a mad poet
rather the prophet has come with the truth and confirmed the previous messengers
indeed you disbelievers will be tasters of the painful punishment
and you will not be recompensed except for what you used to do
but not the chosen servants of allah
those will have a provision determined
fruits and they will be honored
in gardens of pleasure
on thrones facing one another
there will be circulated among them a cup of wine from a flowing spring
white and delicious to the drinkers
no bad effect is there in it nor from it will they be intoxicated
and with them will be women limiting their glances with large beautiful eyes
as if they were delicate eggs well protected
and they will approach one another inquiring of each other
a speaker among them will say indeed i had a companion on earth
who would say are you indeed of those who believe
that when we have died and become dust and bones we will indeed be recompensed
he will say would you care to look
and he will look and see him in the midst of the hellfire
he will say by allah you almost ruined me
if not for the favor of my lord i would have been of those brought in to hell
then are we not to die
except for our first death and we will not be punished
indeed this is the great attainment
for the like of this let the workers on earth work
is paradise a better accommodation or the tree of zaqqum
indeed we have made it a torment for the wrongdoers
indeed it is a tree issuing from the bottom of the hellfire
its emerging fruit as if it was heads of the devils
and indeed they will eat from it and fill with it their bellies
then indeed they will have after it a mixture of scalding water
then indeed their return will be to the hellfire
indeed they found their fathers astray
so they hastened to follow in their footsteps
and there had already strayed before them most of the former peoples
and we had already sent among them warners
then look how was the end of those who were warned
but not the chosen servants of allah
and noah had certainly called us and we are the best of responders
and we saved him and his family from the great affliction
and we made his descendants those remaining on the earth
and left for him favorable mention among later generations
peace upon noah among the worlds
indeed we thus reward the doers of good
indeed he was of our believing servants
then we drowned the disbelievers
and indeed among his kind was abraham
when he came to his lord with a sound heart
and when he said to his father and his people what do you worship
is it falsehood as gods other than allah you desire
then what is your thought about the lord of the worlds
and he cast a look at the stars
and said indeed i am about to be ill
so they turned away from him departing
then he turned to their gods and said do you not eat
what is wrong with you that you do not speak
and he turned upon them a blow with his right hand
then the people came toward him hastening
he said do you worship that which you yourselves carve
while allah created you and that which you do
they said construct for him a furnace and throw him into the burning fire
and they intended for him a plan but we made them the most debased
and then he said indeed i will go to where i am ordered by my lord he will guide me
my lord grant me a child from among the righteous
so we gave him good tidings of a forbearing boy
and when he reached with him the age of exertion he said o my son indeed i have seen in a dream that i must sacrifice you so see what you think he said o my father do as you are commanded you will find me if allah wills of the steadfast
and when they had both submitted and he put him down upon his forehead
we called to him o abraham
you have fulfilled the vision indeed we thus reward the doers of good
indeed this was the clear trial
and we ransomed him with a great sacrifice
and we left for him favorable mention among later generations
peace upon abraham
indeed we thus reward the doers of good
indeed he was of our believing servants
and we gave him good tidings of isaac a prophet from among the righteous
and we blessed him and isaac but among their descendants is the doer of good and the clearly unjust to himself
and we did certainly confer favor upon moses and aaron
and we saved them and their people from the great affliction
and we supported them so it was they who overcame
and we gave them the explicit scripture
and we guided them on the straight path
and we left for them favorable mention among later generations
peace upon moses and aaron
indeed we thus reward the doers of good
indeed they were of our believing servants
and indeed elias was from among the messengers
when he said to his people will you not fear allah
do you call upon ba l and leave the best of creators
allah your lord and the lord of your first forefathers
and they denied him so indeed they will be brought for punishment
except the chosen servants of allah
and we left for him favorable mention among later generations
peace upon elias
indeed we thus reward the doers of good
indeed he was of our believing servants
and indeed lot was among the messengers
so mention when we saved him and his family all
except his wife among those who remained with the evildoers
then we destroyed the others
and indeed you pass by them in the morning
and at night then will you not use reason
and indeed jonah was among the messengers
mention when he ran away to the laden ship
and he drew lots and was among the losers
then the fish swallowed him while he was blameworthy
and had he not been of those who exalt allah
he would have remained inside its belly until the day they are resurrected
but we threw him onto the open shore while he was ill
and we caused to grow over him a gourd vine
and we sent him to his people of a hundred thousand or more
and they believed so we gave them enjoyment of life for a time
so inquire of them o muhammad does your lord have daughters while they have sons
or did we create the angels as females while they were witnesses
unquestionably it is out of their invented falsehood that they say
allah has begotten and indeed they are liars
has he chosen daughters over sons
what is wrong with you how do you make judgement
then will you not be reminded
or do you have a clear authority
then produce your scripture if you should be truthful
and they have claimed between him and the jinn a lineage but the jinn have already known that they who made such claims will be brought to punishment
exalted is allah above what they describe
except the chosen servants of allah who do not share in that sin
so indeed you disbelievers and whatever you worship
you cannot tempt anyone away from him
except he who is to enter and burn in the hellfire
the angels say there is not among us any except that he has a known position
and indeed we are those who line up for prayer
and indeed we are those who exalt allah
and indeed the disbelievers used to say
if we had a message from those of the former peoples
we would have been the chosen servants of allah
but they disbelieved in it so they are going to know
and our word has already preceded for our servants the messengers
that indeed they would be those given victory
and that indeed our soldiers will be those who overcome
so o muhammad leave them for a time
and see what will befall them for they are going to see
then for our punishment are they impatient
but when it descends in their territory then evil is the morning of those who were warned
and leave them for a time
and see for they are going to see
exalted is your lord the lord of might above what they describe
and peace upon the messengers
and praise to allah lord of the worlds
sad by the qur an containing reminder
but those who disbelieve are in pride and dissension
how many a generation have we destroyed before them and they then called out but it was not a time for escape
and they wonder that there has come to them a warner from among themselves and the disbelievers say this is a magician and a liar
has he made the gods only one god indeed this is a curious thing
and the eminent among them went forth saying continue and be patient over the defense of your gods indeed this is a thing intended
we have not heard of this in the latest religion this is not but a fabrication
has the message been revealed to him out of all of us rather they are in doubt about my message rather they have not yet tasted my punishment
or do they have the depositories of the mercy of your lord the exalted in might the bestower
or is theirs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and what is between them then let them ascend through any ways of access
they are but soldiers who will be defeated there among the companies of disbelievers
the people of noah denied before them and the tribe of aad and pharaoh the owner of stakes
and the tribe of thamud and the people of lot and the companions of the thicket those are the companies
each of them denied the messengers so my penalty was justified
and these disbelievers await not but one blast of the horn for it there will be no delay
and they say our lord hasten for us our share of the punishment before the day of account
be patient over what they say and remember our servant david the possessor of strength indeed he was one who repeatedly turned back to allah
indeed we subjected the mountains to praise with him exalting allah in the late afternoon and after sunrise
and the birds were assembled all with him repeating praises
and we strengthened his kingdom and gave him wisdom and discernment in speech
and has there come to you the news of the adversaries when they climbed over the wall of his prayer chamber
when they entered upon david and he was alarmed by them they said fear not we are two adversaries one of whom has wronged the other so judge between us with truth and do not exceed it and guide us to the sound path
indeed this my brother has ninety nine ewes and i have one ewe so he said entrust her to me and he overpowered me in speech
david said he has certainly wronged you in demanding your ewe in addition to his ewes and indeed many associates oppress one another except for those who believe and do righteous deeds and few are they and david became certain that we had tried him and he asked forgiveness of his lord and fell down bowing in prostration and turned in repentance to allah
so we forgave him that and indeed for him is nearness to us and a good place of return
we said o david indeed we have made you a successor upon the earth so judge between the people in truth and do not follow your own desire as it will lead you astray from the way of allah indeed those who go astray from the way of allah will have a severe punishment for having forgotten the day of account
and we did not create the heaven and the earth and that between them aimlessly that is the assumption of those who disbelieve so woe to those who disbelieve from the fire
or should we treat those who believe and do righteous deeds like corrupters in the land or should we treat those who fear allah like the wicked
this is a blessed book which we have revealed to you o muhammad that they might reflect upon its verses and that those of understanding would be reminded
and to david we gave solomon an excellent servant indeed he was one repeatedly turning back to allah
mention when there were exhibited before him in the afternoon the poised standing racehorses
and he said indeed i gave preference to the love of good things over the remembrance of my lord until the sun disappeared into the curtain of darkness
he said return them to me and set about striking their legs and necks
and we certainly tried solomon and placed on his throne a body then he returned
he said my lord forgive me and grant me a kingdom such as will not belong to anyone after me indeed you are the bestower
so we subjected to him the wind blowing by his command gently wherever he directed
and also the devils of jinn every builder and diver
and others bound together in shackles
we said this is our gift so grant or withhold without account
and indeed for him is nearness to us and a good place of return
and remember our servant job when he called to his lord indeed satan has touched me with hardship and torment
so he was told strike the ground with your foot this is a spring for a cool bath and drink
and we granted him his family and a like number with them as mercy from us and a reminder for those of understanding
we said and take in your hand a bunch of grass and strike with it and do not break your oath indeed we found him patient an excellent servant indeed he was one repeatedly turning back to allah
and remember our servants abraham isaac and jacob those of strength and religious vision
indeed we chose them for an exclusive quality remembrance of the home of the hereafter
and indeed they are to us among the chosen and outstanding
and remember ishmael elisha and dhul kifl and all are among the outstanding
this is a reminder and indeed for the righteous is a good place of return
gardens of perpetual residence whose doors will be opened to them
reclining within them they will call therein for abundant fruit and drink
and with them will be women limiting their glances and of equal age
this is what you the righteous are promised for the day of account
indeed this is our provision for it there is no depletion
this is so but indeed for the transgressors is an evil place of return
hell which they will enter to burn and wretched is the resting place
this so let them taste it is scalding water and foul purulence
and other punishments of its type in various kinds
its inhabitants will say this is a company bursting in with you no welcome for them indeed they will burn in the fire
they will say nor you no welcome for you you our leaders brought this upon us and wretched is the settlement
they will say our lord whoever brought this upon us increase for him double punishment in the fire
and they will say why do we not see men whom we used to count among the worst
is it because we took them in ridicule or has our vision turned away from them
indeed that is truth the quarreling of the people of the fire
say o muhammad i am only a warner and there is not any deity except allah the one the prevailing
lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them the exalted in might the perpetual forgiver
say it is great news
from which you turn away
i had no knowledge of the exalted assembly of angels when they were disputing the creation of adam
it has not been revealed to me except that i am a clear warner
so mention when your lord said to the angels indeed i am going to create a human being from clay
so when i have proportioned him and breathed into him of my created soul then fall down to him in prostration
so the angels prostrated all of them entirely
except iblees he was arrogant and became among the disbelievers
allah said o iblees what prevented you from prostrating to that which i created with my hands were you arrogant then or were you already among the haughty
he said i am better than him you created me from fire and created him from clay
allah said then get out of paradise for indeed you are expelled
and indeed upon you is my curse until the day of recompense
he said my lord then reprieve me until the day they are resurrected
allah said so indeed you are of those reprieved
until the day of the time well known
iblees said by your might i will surely mislead them all
except among them your chosen servants
allah said the truth is my oath and the truth i say
that i will surely fill hell with you and those of them that follow you all together
say o muhammad i do not ask you for the qur an any payment and i am not of the pretentious
it is but a reminder to the worlds
and you will surely know the truth of its information after a time
the revelation of the qur an is from allah the exalted in might the wise
indeed we have sent down to you the book o muhammad in truth so worship allah being sincere to him in religion
unquestionably for allah is the pure religion and those who take protectors besides him say we only worship them that they may bring us nearer to allah in position indeed allah will judge between them concerning that over which they differ indeed allah does not guide he who is a liar and confirmed disbeliever
if allah had intended to take a son he could have chosen from what he creates whatever he willed exalted is he he is allah the one the prevailing
he created the heavens and earth in truth he wraps the night over the day and wraps the day over the night and has subjected the sun and the moon each running its course for a specified term unquestionably he is the exalted in might the perpetual forgiver
he created you from one soul then he made from it its mate and he produced for you from the grazing livestock eight mates he creates you in the wombs of your mothers creation after creation within three darknesses that is allah your lord to him belongs dominion there is no deity except him so how are you averted
if you disbelieve indeed allah is free from need of you and he does not approve for his servants disbelief and if you are grateful he approves it for you and no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another then to your lord is your return and he will inform you about what you used to do indeed he is knowing of that within the breasts
and when adversity touches man he calls upon his lord turning to him alone then when he bestows on him a favor from himself he forgets him whom he called upon before and he attributes to allah equals to mislead people from his way say enjoy your disbelief for a little indeed you are of the companions of the fire
is one who is devoutly obedient during periods of the night prostrating and standing in prayer fearing the hereafter and hoping for the mercy of his lord like one who does not say are those who know equal to those who do not know only they will remember who are people of understanding
say o my servants who have believed fear your lord for those who do good in this world is good and the earth of allah is spacious indeed the patient will be given their reward without account
say o muhammad indeed i have been commanded to worship allah being sincere to him in religion
and i have been commanded to be the first among you of the muslims
say indeed i fear if i should disobey my lord the punishment of a tremendous day
say allah alone do i worship sincere to him in my religion
so worship what you will besides him say indeed the losers are the ones who will lose themselves and their families on the day of resurrection unquestionably that is the manifest loss
they will have canopies of fire above them and below them canopies by that allah threatens his servants o my servants then fear me
but those who have avoided taghut lest they worship it and turned back to allah for them are good tidings so give good tidings to my servants
who listen to speech and follow the best of it those are the ones allah has guided and those are people of understanding
then is one who has deserved the decree of punishment to be guided then can you save one who is in the fire
but those who have feared their lord for them are chambers above them chambers built high beneath which rivers flow this is the promise of allah allah does not fail in his promise
do you not see that allah sends down rain from the sky and makes it flow as springs and rivers in the earth then he produces thereby crops of varying colors then they dry and you see them turned yellow then he makes them scattered debris indeed in that is a reminder for those of understanding
so is one whose breast allah has expanded to accept islam and he is upon a light from his lord like one whose heart rejects it then woe to those whose hearts are hardened against the remembrance of allah those are in manifest error
allah has sent down the best statement a consistent book wherein is reiteration the skins shiver therefrom of those who fear their lord then their skins and their hearts relax at the remembrance of allah that is the guidance of allah by which he guides whom he wills and one whom allah leaves astray for him there is no guide
then is he who will shield with his face the worst of the punishment on the day of resurrection like one secure from it and it will be said to the wrongdoers taste what you used to earn
those before them denied and punishment came upon them from where they did not perceive
so allah made them taste disgrace in worldly life but the punishment of the hereafter is greater if they only knew
and we have certainly presented for the people in this qur an from every kind of example that they might remember
it is an arabic qur an without any deviance that they might become righteous
allah presents an example a slave owned by quarreling partners and another belonging exclusively to one man are they equal in comparison praise be to allah but most of them do not know
indeed you are to die and indeed they are to die
then indeed you on the day of resurrection before your lord will dispute
so who is more unjust than one who lies about allah and denies the truth when it has come to him is there not in hell a residence for the disbelievers
and the one who has brought the truth and they who believed in it those are the righteous
they will have whatever they desire with their lord that is the reward of the doers of good
that allah may remove from them the worst of what they did and reward them their due for the best of what they used to do
is not allah sufficient for his servant prophet muhammad and yet they threaten you with those they worship other than him and whoever allah leaves astray for him there is no guide
and whoever allah guides for him there is no misleader is not allah exalted in might and owner of retribution
and if you asked them who created the heavens and the earth they would surely say allah say then have you considered what you invoke besides allah if allah intended me harm are they removers of his harm or if he intended me mercy are they withholders of his mercy say sufficient for me is allah upon him alone rely the wise reliers
say o my people work according to your position for indeed i am working and you are going to know
to whom will come a torment disgracing him and on whom will descend an enduring punishment
indeed we sent down to you the book for the people in truth so whoever is guided it is for the benefit of his soul and whoever goes astray only goes astray to its detriment and you are not a manager over them
allah takes the souls at the time of their death and those that do not die he takes during their sleep then he keeps those for which he has decreed death and releases the others for a specified term indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought
or have they taken other than allah as intercessors say even though they do not possess power over anything nor do they reason
say to allah belongs the right to allow intercession entirely to him belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth then to him you will be returned
and when allah is mentioned alone the hearts of those who do not believe in the hereafter shrink with aversion but when those worshipped other than him are mentioned immediately they rejoice
say o allah creator of the heavens and the earth knower of the unseen and the witnessed you will judge between your servants concerning that over which they used to differ
and if those who did wrong had all that is in the earth entirely and the like of it with it they would attempt to ransom themselves thereby from the worst of the punishment on the day of resurrection and there will appear to them from allah that which they had not taken into account
and there will appear to them the evils they had earned and they will be enveloped by what they used to ridicule
and when adversity touches man he calls upon us then when we bestow on him a favor from us he says i have only been given it because of my knowledge rather it is a trial but most of them do not know
those before them had already said it but they were not availed by what they used to earn
and the evil consequences of what they earned struck them and those who have wronged of these people will be afflicted by the evil consequences of what they earned and they will not cause failure
do they not know that allah extends provision for whom he wills and restricts it indeed in that are signs for a people who believe
say o my servants who have transgressed against themselves by sinning do not despair of the mercy of allah indeed allah forgives all sins indeed it is he who is the forgiving the merciful
and return in repentance to your lord and submit to him before the punishment comes upon you then you will not be helped
and follow the best of what was revealed to you from your lord before the punishment comes upon you suddenly while you do not perceive
lest a soul should say oh how great is my regret over what i neglected in regard to allah and that i was among the mockers
or lest it say if only allah had guided me i would have been among the righteous
or lest it say when it sees the punishment if only i had another turn so i could be among the doers of good
but yes there had come to you my verses but you denied them and were arrogant and you were among the disbelievers
and on the day of resurrection you will see those who lied about allah with their faces blackened is there not in hell a residence for the arrogant
and allah will save those who feared him by their attainment no evil will touch them nor will they grieve
allah is the creator of all things and he is over all things disposer of affairs
to him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth and they who disbelieve in the verses of allah it is those who are the losers
say o muhammad is it other than allah that you order me to worship o ignorant ones
and it was already revealed to you and to those before you that if you should associate anything with allah your work would surely become worthless and you would surely be among the losers
rather worship only allah and be among the grateful
they have not appraised allah with true appraisal while the earth entirely will be within his grip on the day of resurrection and the heavens will be folded in his right hand exalted is he and high above what they associate with him
and the horn will be blown and whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth will fall dead except whom allah wills then it will be blown again and at once they will be standing looking on
and the earth will shine with the light of its lord and the record of deeds will be placed and the prophets and the witnesses will be brought and it will be judged between them in truth and they will not be wronged
and every soul will be fully compensated for what it did and he is most knowing of what they do
and those who disbelieved will be driven to hell in groups until when they reach it its gates are opened and its keepers will say did there not come to you messengers from yourselves reciting to you the verses of your lord and warning you of the meeting of this day of yours they will say yes but the word of punishment has come into effect upon the disbelievers
to them it will be said enter the gates of hell to abide eternally therein and wretched is the residence of the arrogant
but those who feared their lord will be driven to paradise in groups until when they reach it while its gates have been opened and its keepers say peace be upon you you have become pure so enter it to abide eternally therein they will enter
and they will say praise to allah who has fulfilled for us his promise and made us inherit the earth so we may settle in paradise wherever we will and excellent is the reward of righteous workers
and you will see the angels surrounding the throne exalting allah with praise of their lord and it will be judged between them in truth and it will be said all praise to allah lord of the worlds
ha meem
the revelation of the book is from allah the exalted in might the knowing
the forgiver of sin acceptor of repentance severe in punishment owner of abundance there is no deity except him to him is the destination
no one disputes concerning the signs of allah except those who disbelieve so be not deceived by their uninhibited movement throughout the land
the people of noah denied before them and the disbelieving factions after them and every nation intended a plot for their messenger to seize him and they disputed by using falsehood to attempt to invalidate thereby the truth so i seized them and how terrible was my penalty
and thus has the word of your lord come into effect upon those who disbelieved that they are companions of the fire
those angels who carry the throne and those around it exalt allah with praise of their lord and believe in him and ask forgiveness for those who have believed saying our lord you have encompassed all things in mercy and knowledge so forgive those who have repented and followed your way and protect them from the punishment of hellfire
our lord and admit them to gardens of perpetual residence which you have promised them and whoever was righteous among their fathers their spouses and their offspring indeed it is you who is the exalted in might the wise
and protect them from the evil consequences of their deeds and he whom you protect from evil consequences that day you will have given him mercy and that is the great attainment
indeed those who disbelieve will be addressed the hatred of allah for you was even greater than your hatred of yourselves this day in hell when you were invited to faith but you refused
they will say our lord you made us lifeless twice and gave us life twice and we have confessed our sins so is there to an exit any way
they will be told that is because when allah was called upon alone you disbelieved but if others were associated with him you believed so the judgement is with allah the most high the grand
it is he who shows you his signs and sends down to you from the sky provision but none will remember except he who turns back in repentance
so invoke allah being sincere to him in religion although the disbelievers dislike it
he is the exalted above all degrees owner of the throne he places the inspiration of his command upon whom he wills of his servants to warn of the day of meeting
the day they come forth nothing concerning them will be concealed from allah to whom belongs all sovereignty this day to allah the one the prevailing
this day every soul will be recompensed for what it earned no injustice today indeed allah is swift in account
and warn them o muhammad of the approaching day when hearts are at the throats filled with distress for the wrongdoers there will be no devoted friend and no intercessor who is obeyed
he knows that which deceives the eyes and what the breasts conceal
and allah judges with truth while those they invoke besides him judge not with anything indeed allah he is the hearing the seeing
have they not traveled through the land and observed how was the end of those who were before them they were greater than them in strength and in impression on the land but allah seized them for their sins and they had not from allah any protector
that was because their messengers were coming to them with clear proofs but they disbelieved so allah seized them indeed he is powerful and severe in punishment
and we did certainly send moses with our signs and a clear authority
to pharaoh haman and qarun but they said he is a magician and a liar
and when he brought them the truth from us they said kill the sons of those who have believed with him and keep their women alive but the plan of the disbelievers is not except in error
and pharaoh said let me kill moses and let him call upon his lord indeed i fear that he will change your religion or that he will cause corruption in the land
but moses said indeed i have sought refuge in my lord and your lord from every arrogant one who does not believe in the day of account
and a believing man from the family of pharaoh who concealed his faith said do you kill a man merely because he says my lord is allah while he has brought you clear proofs from your lord and if he should be lying then upon him is the consequence of his lie but if he should be truthful there will strike you some of what he promises you indeed allah does not guide one who is a transgressor and a liar
o my people sovereignty is yours today your being dominant in the land but who would protect us from the punishment of allah if it came to us pharaoh said i do not show you except what i see and i do not guide you except to the way of right conduct
and he who believed said o my people indeed i fear for you a fate like the day of the companies
like the custom of the people of noah and of aad and thamud and those after them and allah wants no injustice for his servants
and o my people indeed i fear for you the day of calling
the day you will turn your backs fleeing there is not for you from allah any protector and whoever allah leaves astray there is not for him any guide
and joseph had already come to you before with clear proofs but you remained in doubt of that which he brought to you until when he died you said never will allah send a messenger after him thus does allah leave astray he who is a transgressor and skeptic
those who dispute concerning the signs of allah without an authority having come to them great is hatred of them in the sight of allah and in the sight of those who have believed thus does allah seal over every heart belonging to an arrogant tyrant
and pharaoh said o haman construct for me a tower that i might reach the ways
the ways into the heavens so that i may look at the deity of moses but indeed i think he is a liar and thus was made attractive to pharaoh the evil of his deed and he was averted from the right way and the plan of pharaoh was not except in ruin
and he who believed said o my people follow me i will guide you to the way of right conduct
o my people this worldly life is only temporary enjoyment and indeed the hereafter that is the home of permanent settlement
whoever does an evil deed will not be recompensed except by the like thereof but whoever does righteousness whether male or female while he is a believer those will enter paradise being given provision therein without account
and o my people how is it that i invite you to salvation while you invite me to the fire
you invite me to disbelieve in allah and associate with him that of which i have no knowledge and i invite you to the exalted in might the perpetual forgiver
assuredly that to which you invite me has no response to a supplication in this world or in the hereafter and indeed our return is to allah and indeed the transgressors will be companions of the fire
and you will remember what i now say to you and i entrust my affair to allah indeed allah is seeing of his servants
so allah protected him from the evils they plotted and the people of pharaoh were enveloped by the worst of punishment
the fire they are exposed to it morning and evening and the day the hour appears it will be said make the people of pharaoh enter the severest punishment
and mention when they will argue within the fire and the weak will say to those who had been arrogant indeed we were only your followers so will you relieve us of a share of the fire
those who had been arrogant will say indeed all of us are in it indeed allah has judged between the servants
and those in the fire will say to the keepers of hell supplicate your lord to lighten for us a day from the punishment
they will say did there not come to you your messengers with clear proofs they will say yes they will reply then supplicate yourselves but the supplication of the disbelievers is not except in error
indeed we will support our messengers and those who believe during the life of this world and on the day when the witnesses will stand
the day their excuse will not benefit the wrongdoers and they will have the curse and they will have the worst home
and we had certainly given moses guidance and we caused the children of israel to inherit the scripture
as guidance and a reminder for those of understanding
so be patient o muhammad indeed the promise of allah is truth and ask forgiveness for your sin and exalt allah with praise of your lord in the evening and the morning
indeed those who dispute concerning the signs of allah without any authority having come to them there is not within their breasts except pride the extent of which they cannot reach so seek refuge in allah indeed it is he who is the hearing the seeing
the creation of the heavens and earth is greater than the creation of mankind but most of the people do not know
and not equal are the blind and the seeing nor are those who believe and do righteous deeds and the evildoer little do you remember
indeed the hour is coming no doubt about it but most of the people do not believe
and your lord says call upon me i will respond to you indeed those who disdain my worship will enter hell rendered contemptible
it is allah who made for you the night that you may rest therein and the day giving sight indeed allah is full of bounty to the people but most of the people are not grateful
that is allah your lord creator of all things there is no deity except him so how are you deluded
thus were those before you deluded who were rejecting the signs of allah
it is allah who made for you the earth a place of settlement and the sky a ceiling and formed you and perfected your forms and provided you with good things that is allah your lord then blessed is allah lord of the worlds
he is the ever living there is no deity except him so call upon him being sincere to him in religion all praise is due to allah lord of the worlds
say o muhammad indeed i have been forbidden to worship those you call upon besides allah once the clear proofs have come to me from my lord and i have been commanded to submit to the lord of the worlds
it is he who created you from dust then from a sperm drop then from a clinging clot then he brings you out as a child then he develops you that you reach your time of maturity then further that you become elders and among you is he who is taken in death before that so that you reach a specified term and perhaps you will use reason
he it is who gives life and causes death and when he decrees a matter he but says to it be and it is
do you not consider those who dispute concerning the signs of allah how are they averted
those who deny the book and that with which we sent our messengers they are going to know
when the shackles are around their necks and the chains they will be dragged
in boiling water then in the fire they will be filled with flame
then it will be said to them where is that which you used to associate with him in worship
other than allah they will say they have departed from us rather we did not used to invoke previously anything thus does allah put astray the disbelievers
the angels will say that was because you used to exult upon the earth without right and you used to behave insolently
enter the gates of hell to abide eternally therein and wretched is the residence of the arrogant
so be patient o muhammad indeed the promise of allah is truth and whether we show you some of what we have promised them or we take you in death it is to us they will be returned
and we have already sent messengers before you among them are those whose stories we have related to you and among them are those whose stories we have not related to you and it was not for any messenger to bring a sign or verse except by permission of allah so when the command of allah comes it will be concluded in truth and the falsifiers will thereupon lose all
it is allah who made for you the grazing animals upon which you ride and some of them you eat
and for you therein are other benefits and that you may realize upon them a need which is in your breasts and upon them and upon ships you are carried
and he shows you his signs so which of the signs of allah do you deny
have they not traveled through the land and observed how was the end of those before them they were more numerous than themselves and greater in strength and in impression on the land but they were not availed by what they used to earn
and when their messengers came to them with clear proofs they merely rejoiced in what they had of knowledge but they were enveloped by what they used to ridicule
and when they saw our punishment they said we believe in allah alone and disbelieve in that which we used to associate with him
but never did their faith benefit them once they saw our punishment it is the established way of allah which has preceded among his servants and the disbelievers thereupon lost all
ha meem
this is a revelation from the entirely merciful the especially merciful
a book whose verses have been detailed an arabic qur an for a people who know
as a giver of good tidings and a warner but most of them turn away so they do not hear
and they say our hearts are within coverings from that to which you invite us and in our ears is deafness and between us and you is a partition so work indeed we are working
say o muhammad i am only a man like you to whom it has been revealed that your god is but one god so take a straight course to him and seek his forgiveness and woe to those who associate others with allah
those who do not give zakah and in the hereafter they are disbelievers
indeed those who believe and do righteous deeds for them is a reward uninterrupted
say do you indeed disbelieve in he who created the earth in two days and attribute to him equals that is the lord of the worlds
and he placed on the earth firmly set mountains over its surface and he blessed it and determined therein its creatures sustenance in four days without distinction for the information of those who ask
then he directed himself to the heaven while it was smoke and said to it and to the earth come into being willingly or by compulsion they said we have come willingly
and he completed them as seven heavens within two days and inspired in each heaven its command and we adorned the nearest heaven with lamps and as protection that is the determination of the exalted in might the knowing
but if they turn away then say i have warned you of a thunderbolt like the thunderbolt that struck aad and thamud
that occurred when the messengers had come to them before them and after them saying worship not except allah they said if our lord had willed he would have sent down the angels so indeed we in that with which you have been sent are disbelievers
as for aad they were arrogant upon the earth without right and said who is greater than us in strength did they not consider that allah who created them was greater than them in strength but they were rejecting our signs
so we sent upon them a screaming wind during days of misfortune to make them taste the punishment of disgrace in the worldly life but the punishment of the hereafter is more disgracing and they will not be helped
and as for thamud we guided them but they preferred blindness over guidance so the thunderbolt of humiliating punishment seized them for what they used to earn
and we saved those who believed and used to fear allah
and mention o muhammad the day when the enemies of allah will be gathered to the fire while they are driven assembled in rows
until when they reach it their hearing and their eyes and their skins will testify against them of what they used to do
and they will say to their skins why have you testified against us they will say we were made to speak by allah who has made everything speak and he created you the first time and to him you are returned
and you were not covering yourselves lest your hearing testify against you or your sight or your skins but you assumed that allah does not know much of what you do
and that was your assumption which you assumed about your lord it has brought you to ruin and you have become among the losers
so even if they are patient the fire is a residence for them and if they ask to appease allah they will not be of those who are allowed to appease
and we appointed for them companions who made attractive to them what was before them and what was behind them of sin and the word has come into effect upon them among nations which had passed on before them of jinn and men indeed they all were losers
and those who disbelieve say do not listen to this qur an and speak noisily during the recitation of it that perhaps you will overcome
but we will surely cause those who disbelieve to taste a severe punishment and we will surely recompense them for the worst of what they had been doing
that is the recompense of the enemies of allah the fire for them therein is the home of eternity as recompense for what they of our verses were rejecting
and those who disbelieved will then say our lord show us those who misled us of the jinn and men so we may put them under our feet that they will be among the lowest
indeed those who have said our lord is allah and then remained on a right course the angels will descend upon them saying do not fear and do not grieve but receive good tidings of paradise which you were promised
we angels were your allies in worldly life and are so in the hereafter and you will have therein whatever your souls desire and you will have therein whatever you request or wish
as accommodation from a lord who is forgiving and merciful
and who is better in speech than one who invites to allah and does righteousness and says indeed i am of the muslims
and not equal are the good deed and the bad repel evil by that deed which is better and thereupon the one whom between you and him is enmity will become as though he was a devoted friend
but none is granted it except those who are patient and none is granted it except one having a great portion of good
and if there comes to you from satan an evil suggestion then seek refuge in allah indeed he is the hearing the knowing
and of his signs are the night and day and the sun and moon do not prostrate to the sun or to the moon but prostate to allah who created them if it should be him that you worship
but if they are arrogant then those who are near your lord exalt him by night and by day and they do not become weary
and of his signs is that you see the earth stilled but when we send down upon it rain it quivers and grows indeed he who has given it life is the giver of life to the dead indeed he is over all things competent
indeed those who inject deviation into our verses are not concealed from us so is he who is cast into the fire better or he who comes secure on the day of resurrection do whatever you will indeed he is seeing of what you do
indeed those who disbelieve in the message after it has come to them and indeed it is a mighty book
falsehood cannot approach it from before it or from behind it it is a revelation from a lord who is wise and praiseworthy
nothing is said to you o muhammad except what was already said to the messengers before you indeed your lord is a possessor of forgiveness and a possessor of painful penalty
and if we had made it a non arabic qur an they would have said why are its verses not explained in detail in our language is it a foreign recitation and an arab messenger say it is for those who believe a guidance and cure and those who do not believe in their ears is deafness and it is upon them blindness those are being called from a distant place
and we had already given moses the scripture but it came under disagreement and if not for a word that preceded from your lord it would have been concluded between them and indeed they are concerning the qur an in disquieting doubt
whoever does righteousness it is for his own soul and whoever does evil does so against it and your lord is not ever unjust to his servants
to him alone is attributed knowledge of the hour and fruits emerge not from their coverings nor does a female conceive or give birth except with his knowledge and the day he will call to them where are my partners they will say we announce to you that there is no longer among us any witness to that
and lost from them will be those they were invoking before and they will be certain that they have no place of escape
man is not weary of supplication for good things but if evil touches him he is hopeless and despairing
and if we let him taste mercy from us after an adversity which has touched him he will surely say this is due to me and i do not think the hour will occur and even if i should be returned to my lord indeed for me there will be with him the best but we will surely inform those who disbelieved about what they did and we will surely make them taste a massive punishment
and when we bestow favor upon man he turns away and distances himself but when evil touches him then he is full of extensive supplication
say have you considered if the qur an is from allah and you disbelieved in it who would be more astray than one who is in extreme dissension
we will show them our signs in the horizons and within themselves until it becomes clear to them that it is the truth but is it not sufficient concerning your lord that he is over all things a witness
unquestionably they are in doubt about the meeting with their lord unquestionably he is of all things encompassing
ha meem
ayn seen qaf
thus has he revealed to you o muhammad and to those before you allah the exalted in might the wise
to him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth and he is the most high the most great
the heavens almost break from above them and the angels exalt allah with praise of their lord and ask forgiveness for those on earth unquestionably it is allah who is the forgiving the merciful
and those who take as allies other than him allah is yet guardian over them and you o muhammad are not over them a manager
and thus we have revealed to you an arabic qur an that you may warn the mother of cities makkah and those around it and warn of the day of assembly about which there is no doubt a party will be in paradise and a party in the blaze
and if allah willed he could have made them of one religion but he admits whom he wills into his mercy and the wrongdoers have not any protector or helper
or have they taken protectors or allies besides him but allah he is the protector and he gives life to the dead and he is over all things competent
and in anything over which you disagree its ruling is to be referred to allah say that is allah my lord upon him i have relied and to him i turn back
he is creator of the heavens and the earth he has made for you from yourselves mates and among the cattle mates he multiplies you thereby there is nothing like unto him and he is the hearing the seeing
to him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth he extends provision for whom he wills and restricts it indeed he is of all things knowing
he has ordained for you of religion what he enjoined upon noah and that which we have revealed to you o muhammad and what we enjoined upon abraham and moses and jesus to establish the religion and not be divided therein difficult for those who associate others with allah is that to which you invite them allah chooses for himself whom he wills and guides to himself whoever turns back to him
and they did not become divided until after knowledge had come to them out of jealous animosity between themselves and if not for a word that preceded from your lord postponing the penalty until a specified time it would have been concluded between them and indeed those who were granted inheritance of the scripture after them are concerning it in disquieting doubt
so to that religion of allah invite o muhammad and remain on a right course as you are commanded and do not follow their inclinations but say i have believed in what allah has revealed of the qur an and i have been commanded to do justice among you allah is our lord and your lord for us are our deeds and for you your deeds there is no need for argument between us and you allah will bring us together and to him is the final destination
and those who argue concerning allah after he has been responded to their argument is invalid with their lord and upon them is his wrath and for them is a severe punishment
it is allah who has sent down the book in truth and also the balance and what will make you perceive perhaps the hour is near
those who do not believe in it are impatient for it but those who believe are fearful of it and know that it is the truth unquestionably those who dispute concerning the hour are in extreme error
allah is subtle with his servants he gives provisions to whom he wills and he is the powerful the exalted in might
whoever desires the harvest of the hereafter we increase for him in his harvest and whoever desires the harvest of this world we give him thereof but there is not for him in the hereafter any share
or have they other deities who have ordained for them a religion to which allah has not consented but if not for the decisive word it would have been concluded between them and indeed the wrongdoers will have a painful punishment
you will see the wrongdoers fearful of what they have earned and it will certainly befall them and those who have believed and done righteous deeds will be in lush regions of the gardens in paradise having whatever they will in the presence of their lord that is what is the great bounty
it is that of which allah gives good tidings to his servants who believe and do righteous deeds say o muhammad i do not ask you for this message any payment but only good will through kinship and whoever commits a good deed we will increase for him good therein indeed allah is forgiving and appreciative
or do they say he has invented about allah a lie but if allah willed he could seal over your heart and allah eliminates falsehood and establishes the truth by his words indeed he is knowing of that within the breasts
and it is he who accepts repentance from his servants and pardons misdeeds and he knows what you do
and he answers the supplication of those who have believed and done righteous deeds and increases for them from his bounty but the disbelievers will have a severe punishment
and if allah had extended excessively provision for his servants they would have committed tyranny throughout the earth but he sends it down in an amount which he wills indeed he is of his servants acquainted and seeing
and it is he who sends down the rain after they had despaired and spreads his mercy and he is the protector the praiseworthy
and of his signs is the creation of the heavens and earth and what he has dispersed throughout them of creatures and he for gathering them when he wills is competent
and whatever strikes you of disaster it is for what your hands have earned but he pardons much
and you will not cause failure to allah upon the earth and you have not besides allah any protector or helper
and of his signs are the ships in the sea like mountains
if he willed he could still the wind and they would remain motionless on its surface indeed in that are signs for everyone patient and grateful
or he could destroy them for what they earned but he pardons much
and that is so those who dispute concerning our signs may know that for them there is no place of escape
so whatever thing you have been given it is but for enjoyment of the worldly life but what is with allah is better and more lasting for those who have believed and upon their lord rely
and those who avoid the major sins and immoralities and when they are angry they forgive
and those who have responded to their lord and established prayer and whose affair is determined by consultation among themselves and from what we have provided them they spend
and those who when tyranny strikes them they defend themselves
and the retribution for an evil act is an evil one like it but whoever pardons and makes reconciliation his reward is due from allah indeed he does not like wrongdoers
and whoever avenges himself after having been wronged those have not upon them any cause for blame
the cause is only against the ones who wrong the people and tyrannize upon the earth without right those will have a painful punishment
and whoever is patient and forgives indeed that is of the matters requiring determination
and he whom allah sends astray for him there is no protector beyond him and you will see the wrongdoers when they see the punishment saying is there for return to the former world any way
and you will see them being exposed to the fire humbled from humiliation looking from behind a covert glance and those who had believed will say indeed the true losers are the ones who lost themselves and their families on the day of resurrection unquestionably the wrongdoers are in an enduring punishment
and there will not be for them any allies to aid them other than allah and whoever allah sends astray for him there is no way
respond to your lord before a day comes from allah of which there is no repelling no refuge will you have that day nor for you will there be any denial
but if they turn away then we have not sent you o muhammad over them as a guardian upon you is only the duty of notification and indeed when we let man taste mercy from us he rejoices in it but if evil afflicts him for what his hands have put forth then indeed man is ungrateful
to allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth he creates what he wills he gives to whom he wills female children and he gives to whom he wills males
or he makes them both males and females and he renders whom he wills barren indeed he is knowing and competent
and it is not for any human being that allah should speak to him except by revelation or from behind a partition or that he sends a messenger to reveal by his permission what he wills indeed he is most high and wise
and thus we have revealed to you an inspiration of our command you did not know what is the book or what is faith but we have made it a light by which we guide whom we will of our servants and indeed o muhammad you guide to a straight path
the path of allah to whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth unquestionably to allah do all matters evolve
ha meem
by the clear book
indeed we have made it an arabic qur an that you might understand
and indeed it is in the mother of the book with us exalted and full of wisdom
then should we turn the message away disregarding you because you are a transgressing people
and how many a prophet we sent among the former peoples
but there would not come to them a prophet except that they used to ridicule him
and we destroyed greater than them in striking power and the example of the former peoples has preceded
and if you should ask them who has created the heavens and the earth they would surely say they were created by the exalted in might the knowing
the one who has made for you the earth a bed and made for you upon it roads that you might be guided
and who sends down rain from the sky in measured amounts and we revive thereby a dead land thus will you be brought forth
and who created the species all of them and has made for you of ships and animals those which you mount
that you may settle yourselves upon their backs and then remember the favor of your lord when you have settled upon them and say exalted is he who has subjected this to us and we could not have otherwise subdued it
and indeed we to our lord will surely return
but they have attributed to him from his servants a portion indeed man is clearly ungrateful
or has he taken out of what he has created daughters and chosen you for having sons
and when one of them is given good tidings of that which he attributes to the most merciful in comparison his face becomes dark and he suppresses grief
so is one brought up in ornaments while being during conflict unevident attributed to allah
and they have made the angels who are servants of the most merciful females did they witness their creation their testimony will be recorded and they will be questioned
and they said if the most merciful had willed we would not have worshipped them they have of that no knowledge they are not but falsifying
or have we given them a book before the qur an to which they are adhering
rather they say indeed we found our fathers upon a religion and we are in their footsteps rightly guided
and similarly we did not send before you any warner into a city except that its affluent said indeed we found our fathers upon a religion and we are in their footsteps following
each warner said even if i brought you better guidance than that religion upon which you found your fathers they said indeed we in that with which you were sent are disbelievers
so we took retribution from them then see how was the end of the deniers
and mention o muhammad when abraham said to his father and his people indeed i am disassociated from that which you worship
except for he who created me and indeed he will guide me
and he made it a word remaining among his descendants that they might return to it
however i gave enjoyment to these people of makkah and their fathers until there came to them the truth and a clear messenger
but when the truth came to them they said this is magic and indeed we are concerning it disbelievers
and they said why was this qur an not sent down upon a great man from one of the two cities
do they distribute the mercy of your lord it is we who have apportioned among them their livelihood in the life of this world and have raised some of them above others in degrees of rank that they may make use of one another for service but the mercy of your lord is better than whatever they accumulate
and if it were not that the people would become one community of disbelievers we would have made for those who disbelieve in the most merciful for their houses ceilings and stairways of silver upon which to mount
and for their houses doors and couches of silver upon which to recline
and gold ornament but all that is not but the enjoyment of worldly life and the hereafter with your lord is for the righteous
and whoever is blinded from remembrance of the most merciful we appoint for him a devil and he is to him a companion
and indeed the devils avert them from the way of guidance while they think that they are rightly guided
until when he comes to us at judgement he says to his companion oh i wish there was between me and you the distance between the east and west how wretched a companion
and never will it benefit you that day when you have wronged that you are all sharing in the punishment
then will you make the deaf hear o muhammad or guide the blind or he who is in clear error
and whether or not we take you away in death indeed we will take retribution upon them
or whether or not we show you that which we have promised them indeed we are perfect in ability
so adhere to that which is revealed to you indeed you are on a straight path
and indeed it is a remembrance for you and your people and you all are going to be questioned
and ask those we sent before you of our messengers have we made besides the most merciful deities to be worshipped
and certainly did we send moses with our signs to pharaoh and his establishment and he said indeed i am the messenger of the lord of the worlds
but when he brought them our signs at once they laughed at them
and we showed them not a sign except that it was greater than its sister and we seized them with affliction that perhaps they might return to faith
and they said to moses o magician invoke for us your lord by what he has promised you indeed we will be guided
but when we removed from them the affliction at once they broke their word
and pharaoh called out among his people he said o my people does not the kingdom of egypt belong to me and these rivers flowing beneath me then do you not see
or am i not better than this one who is insignificant and hardly makes himself clear
then why have there not been placed upon him bracelets of gold or come with him the angels in conjunction
so he bluffed his people and they obeyed him indeed they were themselves a people defiantly disobedient of allah
and when they angered us we took retribution from them and drowned them all
and we made them a precedent and an example for the later peoples
and when the son of mary was presented as an example immediately your people laughed aloud
and they said are your gods better or is he they did not present the comparison except for mere argument but in fact they are a people prone to dispute
jesus was not but a servant upon whom we bestowed favor and we made him an example for the children of israel
and if we willed we could have made instead of you angels succeeding one another on the earth
and indeed jesus will be a sign for knowledge of the hour so be not in doubt of it and follow me this is a straight path
and never let satan avert you indeed he is to you a clear enemy
and when jesus brought clear proofs he said i have come to you with wisdom and to make clear to you some of that over which you differ so fear allah and obey me
indeed allah is my lord and your lord so worship him this is a straight path
but the denominations from among them differed and separated so woe to those who have wronged from the punishment of a painful day
are they waiting except for the hour to come upon them suddenly while they perceive not
close friends that day will be enemies to each other except for the righteous
to whom allah will say o my servants no fear will there be concerning you this day nor will you grieve
you who believed in our verses and were muslims
enter paradise you and your kinds delighted
circulated among them will be plates and vessels of gold and therein is whatever the souls desire and what delights the eyes and you will abide therein eternally
and that is paradise which you are made to inherit for what you used to do
for you therein is much fruit from which you will eat
indeed the criminals will be in the punishment of hell abiding eternally
it will not be allowed to subside for them and they therein are in despair
and we did not wrong them but it was they who were the wrongdoers
and they will call o malik let your lord put an end to us he will say indeed you will remain
we had certainly brought you the truth but most of you to the truth were averse
or have they devised some affair but indeed we are devising a plan
or do they think that we hear not their secrets and their private conversations yes we do and our messengers are with them recording
say o muhammad if the most merciful had a son then i would be the first of his worshippers
exalted is the lord of the heavens and the earth lord of the throne above what they describe
so leave them to converse vainly and amuse themselves until they meet their day which they are promised
and it is allah who is the only deity in the heaven and on the earth the only deity and he is the wise the knowing
and blessed is he to whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them and with whom is knowledge of the hour and to whom you will be returned
and those they invoke besides him do not possess power of intercession but only those who testify to the truth can benefit and they know
and if you asked them who created them they would surely say allah so how are they deluded
and allah acknowledges his saying o my lord indeed these are a people who do not believe
so turn aside from them and say peace but they are going to know
ha meem
by the clear book
indeed we sent it down during a blessed night indeed we were to warn mankind
on that night is made distinct every precise matter
every matter proceeding from us indeed we were to send a messenger
as mercy from your lord indeed he is the hearing the knowing
lord of the heavens and the earth and that between them if you would be certain
there is no deity except him he gives life and causes death he is your lord and the lord of your first forefathers
but they are in doubt amusing themselves
then watch for the day when the sky will bring a visible smoke
covering the people this is a painful torment
they will say our lord remove from us the torment indeed we are believers
how will there be for them a reminder at that time and there had come to them a clear messenger
then they turned away from him and said he was taught and is a madman
indeed we will remove the torment for a little indeed you disbelievers will return to disbelief
the day we will strike with the greatest assault indeed we will take retribution
and we had already tried before them the people of pharaoh and there came to them a noble messenger
saying render to me the servants of allah indeed i am to you a trustworthy messenger
and saying be not haughty with allah indeed i have come to you with clear authority
and indeed i have sought refuge in my lord and your lord lest you stone me
but if you do not believe me then leave me alone
and finally he called to his lord that these were a criminal people
allah said then set out with my servants by night indeed you are to be pursued
and leave the sea in stillness indeed they are an army to be drowned
how much they left behind of gardens and springs
and crops and noble sites
and comfort wherein they were amused
thus and we caused to inherit it another people
and the heaven and earth wept not for them nor were they reprieved
and we certainly saved the children of israel from the humiliating torment
from pharaoh indeed he was a haughty one among the transgressors
and we certainly chose them by knowledge over all the worlds
and we gave them of signs that in which there was a clear trial
indeed these disbelievers are saying
there is not but our first death and we will not be resurrected
then bring back our forefathers if you should be truthful
are they better or the people of tubba and those before them we destroyed them for indeed they were criminals
and we did not create the heavens and earth and that between them in play
we did not create them except in truth but most of them do not know
indeed the day of judgement is the appointed time for them all
the day when no relation will avail a relation at all nor will they be helped
except those believers on whom allah has mercy indeed he is the exalted in might the merciful
indeed the tree of zaqqum
is food for the sinful
like murky oil it boils within bellies
like the boiling of scalding water
it will be commanded seize him and drag him into the midst of the hellfire
then pour over his head from the torment of scalding water
it will be said taste indeed you are the honored the noble
indeed this is what you used to dispute
indeed the righteous will be in a secure place
within gardens and springs
wearing garments of fine silk and brocade facing each other
thus and we will marry them to fair women with large beautiful eyes
they will call therein for every kind of fruit safe and secure
they will not taste death therein except the first death and he will have protected them from the punishment of hellfire
as bounty from your lord that is what is the great attainment
and indeed we have eased the qur an in your tongue that they might be reminded
so watch o muhammad indeed they are watching for your end
ha meem
the revelation of the book is from allah the exalted in might the wise
indeed within the heavens and earth are signs for the believers
and in the creation of yourselves and what he disperses of moving creatures are signs for people who are certain in faith
and in the alternation of night and day and in what allah sends down from the sky of provision and gives life thereby to the earth after its lifelessness and in his directing of the winds are signs for a people who reason
these are the verses of allah which we recite to you in truth then in what statement after allah and his verses will they believe
woe to every sinful liar
who hears the verses of allah recited to him then persists arrogantly as if he had not heard them so give him tidings of a painful punishment
and when he knows anything of our verses he takes them in ridicule those will have a humiliating punishment
before them is hell and what they had earned will not avail them at all nor what they had taken besides allah as allies and they will have a great punishment
this qur an is guidance and those who have disbelieved in the verses of their lord will have a painful punishment of foul nature
it is allah who subjected to you the sea so that ships may sail upon it by his command and that you may seek of his bounty and perhaps you will be grateful
and he has subjected to you whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth all from him indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought
say o muhammad to those who have believed that they should forgive those who expect not the days of allah so that he may recompense a people for what they used to earn
whoever does a good deed it is for himself and whoever does evil it is against the self then to your lord you will be returned
and we did certainly give the children of israel the scripture and judgement and prophethood and we provided them with good things and preferred them over the worlds
and we gave them clear proofs of the matter of religion and they did not differ except after knowledge had come to them out of jealous animosity between themselves indeed your lord will judge between them on the day of resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ
then we put you o muhammad on an ordained way concerning the matter of religion so follow it and do not follow the inclinations of those who do not know
indeed they will never avail you against allah at all and indeed the wrongdoers are allies of one another but allah is the protector of the righteous
this qur an is enlightenment for mankind and guidance and mercy for a people who are certain in faith
or do those who commit evils think we will make them like those who have believed and done righteous deeds make them equal in their life and their death evil is that which they judge
and allah created the heavens and earth in truth and so that every soul may be recompensed for what it has earned and they will not be wronged
have you seen he who has taken as his god his own desire and allah has sent him astray due to knowledge and has set a seal upon his hearing and his heart and put over his vision a veil so who will guide him after allah then will you not be reminded
and they say there is not but our worldly life we die and live and nothing destroys us except time and they have of that no knowledge they are only assuming
and when our verses are recited to them as clear evidences their argument is only that they say bring back our forefathers if you should be truthful
say allah causes you to live then causes you to die then he will assemble you for the day of resurrection about which there is no doubt but most of the people do not know
and to allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and the day the hour appears that day the falsifiers will lose
and you will see every nation kneeling from fear every nation will be called to its record and told today you will be recompensed for what you used to do
this our record speaks about you in truth indeed we were having transcribed whatever you used to do
so as for those who believed and did righteous deeds their lord will admit them into his mercy that is what is the clear attainment
but as for those who disbelieved it will be said were not our verses recited to you but you were arrogant and became a people of criminals
and when it was said indeed the promise of allah is truth and the hour is coming no doubt about it you said we know not what is the hour we assume only assumption and we are not convinced
and the evil consequences of what they did will appear to them and they will be enveloped by what they used to ridicule
and it will be said today we will forget you as you forgot the meeting of this day of yours and your refuge is the fire and for you there are no helpers
that is because you took the verses of allah in ridicule and worldly life deluded you so that day they will not be removed from it nor will they be asked to appease allah
then to allah belongs all praise lord of the heavens and lord of the earth lord of the worlds
and to him belongs all grandeur within the heavens and the earth and he is the exalted in might the wise
ha meem
the revelation of the book is from allah the exalted in might the wise
we did not create the heavens and earth and what is between them except in truth and for a specified term but those who disbelieve from that of which they are warned are turning away
say o muhammad have you considered that which you invoke besides allah show me what they have created of the earth or did they have partnership in creation of the heavens bring me a scripture revealed before this or a remaining trace of knowledge if you should be truthful
and who is more astray than he who invokes besides allah those who will not respond to him until the day of resurrection and they of their invocation are unaware
and when the people are gathered that day they who were invoked will be enemies to them and they will be deniers of their worship
and when our verses are recited to them as clear evidences those who disbelieve say of the truth when it has come to them this is obvious magic
or do they say he has invented it say if i have invented it you will not possess for me the power of protection from allah at all he is most knowing of that in which you are involved sufficient is he as witness between me and you and he is the forgiving the merciful
say i am not something original among the messengers nor do i know what will be done with me or with you i only follow that which is revealed to me and i am not but a clear warner
say have you considered if the qur an was from allah and you disbelieved in it while a witness from the children of israel has testified to something similar and believed while you were arrogant indeed allah does not guide the wrongdoing people
and those who disbelieve say of those who believe if it had truly been good they would not have preceded us to it and when they are not guided by it they will say this is an ancient falsehood
and before it was the scripture of moses to lead and as a mercy and this is a confirming book in an arabic tongue to warn those who have wronged and as good tidings to the doers of good
indeed those who have said our lord is allah and then remained on a right course there will be no fear concerning them nor will they grieve
those are the companions of paradise abiding eternally therein as reward for what they used to do
and we have enjoined upon man to his parents good treatment his mother carried him with hardship and gave birth to him with hardship and his gestation and weaning period is thirty months he grows until when he reaches maturity and reaches the age of forty years he says my lord enable me to be grateful for your favor which you have bestowed upon me and upon my parents and to work righteousness of which you will approve and make righteous for me my offspring indeed i have repented to you and indeed i am of the muslims
those are the ones from whom we will accept the best of what they did and overlook their misdeeds their being among the companions of paradise that is the promise of truth which they had been promised
but one who says to his parents uff to you do you promise me that i will be brought forth from the earth when generations before me have already passed on into oblivion while they call to allah for help and to their son woe to you believe indeed the promise of allah is truth but he says this is not but legends of the former people
those are the ones upon whom the word has come into effect who will be among nations which had passed on before them of jinn and men indeed they all were losers
and for all there are degrees of reward and punishment for what they have done and it is so that he may fully compensate them for their deeds and they will not be wronged
and the day those who disbelieved are exposed to the fire it will be said you exhausted your pleasures during your worldly life and enjoyed them so this day you will be awarded the punishment of extreme humiliation because you were arrogant upon the earth without right and because you were defiantly disobedient
and mention o muhammad the brother of aad when he warned his people in the region of al ahqaf and warners had already passed on before him and after him saying do not worship except allah indeed i fear for you the punishment of a terrible day
they said have you come to delude us away from our gods then bring us what you promise us if you should be of the truthful
he said knowledge of its time is only with allah and i convey to you that with which i was sent but i see you to be a people behaving ignorantly
and when they saw it as a cloud approaching their valleys they said this is a cloud bringing us rain rather it is that for which you were impatient a wind within it a painful punishment
destroying everything by command of its lord and they became so that nothing was seen of them except their dwellings thus do we recompense the criminal people
and we had certainly established them in such as we have not established you and we made for them hearing and vision and hearts but their hearing and vision and hearts availed them not from anything of the punishment when they were continually rejecting the signs of allah and they were enveloped by what they used to ridicule
and we have already destroyed what surrounds you of those cities and we have diversified the signs or verses that perhaps they might return from disbelief
then why did those they took besides allah as deities by which to approach him not aid them but they had strayed from them and that was their falsehood and what they were inventing
and mention o muhammad when we directed to you a few of the jinn listening to the qur an and when they attended it they said listen quietly and when it was concluded they went back to their people as warners
they said o our people indeed we have heard a recited book revealed after moses confirming what was before it which guides to the truth and to a straight path
o our people respond to the messenger of allah and believe in him allah will forgive for you your sins and protect you from a painful punishment
but he who does not respond to the caller of allah will not cause failure to him upon earth and he will not have besides him any protectors those are in manifest error
do they not see that allah who created the heavens and earth and did not fail in their creation is able to give life to the dead yes indeed he is over all things competent
and the day those who disbelieved are exposed to the fire it will be said is this not the truth they will say yes by our lord he will say then taste the punishment because you used to disbelieve
so be patient o muhammad as were those of determination among the messengers and do not be impatient for them it will be on the day they see that which they are promised as though they had not remained in the world except an hour of a day this is notification and will any be destroyed except the defiantly disobedient people
those who disbelieve and avert people from the way of allah he will waste their deeds
and those who believe and do righteous deeds and believe in what has been sent down upon muhammad and it is the truth from their lord he will remove from them their misdeeds and amend their condition
that is because those who disbelieve follow falsehood and those who believe follow the truth from their lord thus does allah present to the people their comparisons
so when you meet those who disbelieve in battle strike their necks until when you have inflicted slaughter upon them then secure their bonds and either confer favor afterwards or ransom them until the war lays down its burdens that is the command and if allah had willed he could have taken vengeance upon them himself but he ordered armed struggle to test some of you by means of others and those who are killed in the cause of allah never will he waste their deeds
he will guide them and amend their condition
and admit them to paradise which he has made known to them
o you who have believed if you support allah he will support you and plant firmly your feet
but those who disbelieve for them is misery and he will waste their deeds
that is because they disliked what allah revealed so he rendered worthless their deeds
have they not traveled through the land and seen how was the end of those before them allah destroyed everything over them and for the disbelievers is something comparable
that is because allah is the protector of those who have believed and because the disbelievers have no protector
indeed allah will admit those who have believed and done righteous deeds to gardens beneath which rivers flow but those who disbelieve enjoy themselves and eat as grazing livestock eat and the fire will be a residence for them
and how many a city was stronger than your city makkah which drove you out we destroyed them and there was no helper for them
so is he who is on clear evidence from his lord like him to whom the evil of his work has been made attractive and they follow their own desires
is the description of paradise which the righteous are promised wherein are rivers of water unaltered rivers of milk the taste of which never changes rivers of wine delicious to those who drink and rivers of purified honey in which they will have from all kinds of fruits and forgiveness from their lord like that of those who abide eternally in the fire and are given to drink scalding water that will sever their intestines
and among them o muhammad are those who listen to you until when they depart from you they say to those who were given knowledge what has he said just now those are the ones of whom allah has sealed over their hearts and who have followed their own desires
and those who are guided he increases them in guidance and gives them their righteousness
then do they await except that the hour should come upon them unexpectedly but already there have come some of its indications then what good to them when it has come will be their remembrance
so know o muhammad that there is no deity except allah and ask forgiveness for your sin and for the believing men and believing women and allah knows of your movement and your resting place
those who believe say why has a surah not been sent down but when a precise surah is revealed and fighting is mentioned therein you see those in whose hearts is hypocrisy looking at you with a look of one overcome by death and more appropriate for them would have been
obedience and good words and when the matter of fighting was determined if they had been true to allah it would have been better for them
so would you perhaps if you turned away cause corruption on earth and sever your ties of relationship
those who do so are the ones that allah has cursed so he deafened them and blinded their vision
then do they not reflect upon the qur an or are there locks upon their hearts
indeed those who reverted back to disbelief after guidance had become clear to them satan enticed them and prolonged hope for them
that is because they said to those who disliked what allah sent down we will obey you in part of the matter and allah knows what they conceal
then how will it be when the angels take them in death striking their faces and their backs
that is because they followed what angered allah and disliked what earns his pleasure so he rendered worthless their deeds
or do those in whose hearts is disease think that allah would never expose their feelings of hatred
and if we willed we could show them to you and you would know them by their mark but you will surely know them by the tone of their speech and allah knows your deeds
and we will surely test you until we make evident those who strive among you for the cause of allah and the patient and we will test your affairs
indeed those who disbelieved and averted people from the path of allah and opposed the messenger after guidance had become clear to them never will they harm allah at all and he will render worthless their deeds
o you who have believed obey allah and obey the messenger and do not invalidate your deeds
indeed those who disbelieved and averted people from the path of allah and then died while they were disbelievers never will allah forgive them
so do not weaken and call for peace while you are superior and allah is with you and will never deprive you of the reward of your deeds
this worldly life is only amusement and diversion and if you believe and fear allah he will give you your rewards and not ask you for your properties
if he should ask you for them and press you you would withhold and he would expose your unwillingness
here you are those invited to spend in the cause of allah but among you are those who withhold out of greed and whoever withholds only withholds benefit from himself and allah is the free of need while you are the needy and if you turn away he will replace you with another people then they will not be the likes of you
indeed we have given you o muhammad a clear conquest
that allah may forgive for you what preceded of your sin and what will follow and complete his favor upon you and guide you to a straight path
and that allah may aid you with a mighty victory
it is he who sent down tranquillity into the hearts of the believers that they would increase in faith along with their present faith and to allah belong the soldiers of the heavens and the earth and ever is allah knowing and wise
and that he may admit the believing men and the believing women to gardens beneath which rivers flow to abide therein eternally and remove from them their misdeeds and ever is that in the sight of allah a great attainment
and that he may punish the hypocrite men and hypocrite women and the polytheist men and polytheist women those who assume about allah an assumption of evil nature upon them is a misfortune of evil nature and allah has become angry with them and has cursed them and prepared for them hell and evil it is as a destination
and to allah belong the soldiers of the heavens and the earth and ever is allah exalted in might and wise
indeed we have sent you as a witness and a bringer of good tidings and a warner
that you people may believe in allah and his messenger and honor him and respect the prophet and exalt allah morning and afternoon
indeed those who pledge allegiance to you o muhammad they are actually pledging allegiance to allah the hand of allah is over their hands so he who breaks his word only breaks it to the detriment of himself and he who fulfills that which he has promised allah he will give him a great reward
those who remained behind of the bedouins will say to you our properties and our families occupied us so ask forgiveness for us they say with their tongues what is not within their hearts say then who could prevent allah at all if he intended for you harm or intended for you benefit rather ever is allah with what you do acquainted
but you thought that the messenger and the believers would never return to their families ever and that was made pleasing in your hearts and you assumed an assumption of evil and became a people ruined
and whoever has not believed in allah and his messenger then indeed we have prepared for the disbelievers a blaze
and to allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth he forgives whom he wills and punishes whom he wills and ever is allah forgiving and merciful
those who remained behind will say when you set out toward the war booty to take it let us follow you they wish to change the words of allah say never will you follow us thus did allah say before so they will say rather you envy us but in fact they were not understanding except a little
say to those who remained behind of the bedouins you will be called to face a people of great military might you may fight them or they will submit so if you obey allah will give you a good reward but if you turn away as you turned away before he will punish you with a painful punishment
there is not upon the blind any guilt or upon the lame any guilt or upon the ill any guilt for remaining behind and whoever obeys allah and his messenger he will admit him to gardens beneath which rivers flow but whoever turns away he will punish him with a painful punishment
certainly was allah pleased with the believers when they pledged allegiance to you o muhammad under the tree and he knew what was in their hearts so he sent down tranquillity upon them and rewarded them with an imminent conquest
and much war booty which they will take and ever is allah exalted in might and wise
allah has promised you much booty that you will take in the future and has hastened for you this victory and withheld the hands of people from you that it may be a sign for the believers and that he may guide you to a straight path
and he promises other victories that you were so far unable to realize which allah has already encompassed and ever is allah over all things competent
and if those makkans who disbelieve had fought you they would have turned their backs in flight then they would not find a protector or a helper
this is the established way of allah which has occurred before and never will you find in the way of allah any change
and it is he who withheld their hands from you and your hands from them within the area of makkah after he caused you to overcome them and ever is allah of what you do seeing
they are the ones who disbelieved and obstructed you from al masjid al haram while the offering was prevented from reaching its place of sacrifice and if not for believing men and believing women whom you did not know that you might trample them and there would befall you because of them dishonor without your knowledge you would have been permitted to enter makkah this was so that allah might admit to his mercy whom he willed if they had been apart from them we would have punished those who disbelieved among them with painful punishment
when those who disbelieved had put into their hearts chauvinism the chauvinism of the time of ignorance but allah sent down his tranquillity upon his messenger and upon the believers and imposed upon them the word of righteousness and they were more deserving of it and worthy of it and ever is allah of all things knowing
certainly has allah showed to his messenger the vision in truth you will surely enter al masjid al haram if allah wills in safety with your heads shaved and hair shortened not fearing anyone he knew what you did not know and has arranged before that a conquest near at hand
it is he who sent his messenger with guidance and the religion of truth to manifest it over all religion and sufficient is allah as witness
muhammad is the messenger of allah and those with him are forceful against the disbelievers merciful among themselves you see them bowing and prostrating in prayer seeking bounty from allah and his pleasure their mark is on their faces from the trace of prostration that is their description in the torah and their description in the gospel is as a plant which produces its offshoots and strengthens them so they grow firm and stand upon their stalks delighting the sowers so that allah may enrage by them the disbelievers allah has promised those who believe and do righteous deeds among them forgiveness and a great reward
o you who have believed do not put yourselves before allah and his messenger but fear allah indeed allah is hearing and knowing
o you who have believed do not raise your voices above the voice of the prophet or be loud to him in speech like the loudness of some of you to others lest your deeds become worthless while you perceive not
indeed those who lower their voices before the messenger of allah they are the ones whose hearts allah has tested for righteousness for them is forgiveness and great reward
indeed those who call you o muhammad from behind the chambers most of them do not use reason
and if they had been patient until you could come out to them it would have been better for them but allah is forgiving and merciful
o you who have believed if there comes to you a disobedient one with information investigate lest you harm a people out of ignorance and become over what you have done regretful
and know that among you is the messenger of allah if he were to obey you in much of the matter you would be in difficulty but allah has endeared to you the faith and has made it pleasing in your hearts and has made hateful to you disbelief defiance and disobedience those are the rightly guided
it is as bounty from allah and favor and allah is knowing and wise
and if two factions among the believers should fight then make settlement between the two but if one of them oppresses the other then fight against the one that oppresses until it returns to the ordinance of allah and if it returns then make settlement between them in justice and act justly indeed allah loves those who act justly
the believers are but brothers so make settlement between your brothers and fear allah that you may receive mercy
o you who have believed let not a people ridicule another people perhaps they may be better than them nor let women ridicule other women perhaps they may be better than them and do not insult one another and do not call each other by offensive nicknames wretched is the name of disobedience after one s faith and whoever does not repent then it is those who are the wrongdoers
o you who have believed avoid much negative assumption indeed some assumption is sin and do not spy or backbite each other would one of you like to eat the flesh of his brother when dead you would detest it and fear allah indeed allah is accepting of repentance and merciful
o mankind indeed we have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another indeed the most noble of you in the sight of allah is the most righteous of you indeed allah is knowing and acquainted
the bedouins say we have believed say you have not yet believed but say instead we have submitted for faith has not yet entered your hearts and if you obey allah and his messenger he will not deprive you from your deeds of anything indeed allah is forgiving and merciful
the believers are only the ones who have believed in allah and his messenger and then doubt not but strive with their properties and their lives in the cause of allah it is those who are the truthful
say would you acquaint allah with your religion while allah knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth and allah is knowing of all things
they consider it a favor to you that they have accepted islam say do not consider your islam a favor to me rather allah has conferred favor upon you that he has guided you to the faith if you should be truthful
indeed allah knows the unseen aspects of the heavens and the earth and allah is seeing of what you do
qaf by the honored qur an
but they wonder that there has come to them a warner from among themselves and the disbelievers say this is an amazing thing
when we have died and have become dust we will return to life that is a distant return
we know what the earth diminishes of them and with us is a retaining record
but they denied the truth when it came to them so they are in a confused condition
have they not looked at the heaven above them how we structured it and adorned it and how it has no rifts
and the earth we spread it out and cast therein firmly set mountains and made grow therein something of every beautiful kind
giving insight and a reminder for every servant who turns to allah
and we have sent down blessed rain from the sky and made grow thereby gardens and grain from the harvest
and lofty palm trees having fruit arranged in layers
as provision for the servants and we have given life thereby to a dead land thus is the resurrection
the people of noah denied before them and the companions of the well and thamud
and aad and pharaoh and the brothers of lot
and the companions of the thicket and the people of tubba all denied the messengers so my threat was justly fulfilled
did we fail in the first creation but they are in confusion over a new creation
and we have already created man and know what his soul whispers to him and we are closer to him than his jugular vein
when the two receivers receive seated on the right and on the left
man does not utter any word except that with him is an observer prepared to record
and the intoxication of death will bring the truth that is what you were trying to avoid
and the horn will be blown that is the day of carrying out the threat
and every soul will come with it a driver and a witness
it will be said you were certainly in unmindfulness of this and we have removed from you your cover so your sight this day is sharp
and his companion the angel will say this record is what is with me prepared
allah will say throw into hell every obstinate disbeliever
preventer of good aggressor and doubter
who made as equal with allah another deity then throw him into the severe punishment
his devil companion will say our lord i did not make him transgress but he himself was in extreme error
allah will say do not dispute before me while i had already presented to you the warning
the word will not be changed with me and never will i be unjust to the servants
on the day we will say to hell have you been filled and it will say are there some more
and paradise will be brought near to the righteous not far
it will be said this is what you were promised for every returner to allah and keeper of his covenant
who feared the most merciful unseen and came with a heart returning in repentance
enter it in peace this is the day of eternity
they will have whatever they wish therein and with us is more
and how many a generation before them did we destroy who were greater than them in striking power and had explored throughout the lands is there any place of escape
indeed in that is a reminder for whoever has a heart or who listens while he is present in mind
and we did certainly create the heavens and earth and what is between them in six days and there touched us no weariness
so be patient o muhammad over what they say and exalt allah with praise of your lord before the rising of the sun and before its setting
and in part of the night exalt him and after prostration
and listen on the day when the caller will call out from a place that is near
the day they will hear the blast of the horn in truth that is the day of emergence from the graves
indeed it is we who give life and cause death and to us is the destination
on the day the earth breaks away from them and they emerge rapidly that is a gathering easy for us
we are most knowing of what they say and you are not over them a tyrant but remind by the qur an whoever fears my threat
by those winds scattering dust dispersing
and those clouds carrying a load of water
and those ships sailing with ease
and those angels apportioning each matter
indeed what you are promised is true
and indeed the recompense is to occur
by the heaven containing pathways
indeed you are in differing speech
deluded away from the qur an is he who is deluded
destroyed are the falsifiers
who are within a flood of confusion and heedless
they ask when is the day of recompense
it is the day they will be tormented over the fire
and will be told taste your torment this is that for which you were impatient
indeed the righteous will be among gardens and springs
accepting what their lord has given them indeed they were before that doers of good
they used to sleep but little of the night
and in the hours before dawn they would ask forgiveness
and from their properties was given the right of the needy petitioner and the deprived
and on the earth are signs for the certain in faith
and in yourselves then will you not see
and in the heaven is your provision and whatever you are promised
then by the lord of the heaven and earth indeed it is truth just as sure as it is that you are speaking
has there reached you the story of the honored guests of abraham
when they entered upon him and said we greet you with peace he answered and upon you peace you are a people unknown
then he went to his family and came with a fat roasted calf
and placed it near them he said will you not eat
and he felt from them apprehension they said fear not and gave him good tidings of a learned boy
and his wife approached with a cry of alarm and struck her face and said i am a barren old woman
they said thus has said your lord indeed he is the wise the knowing
abraham said then what is your business here o messengers
they said indeed we have been sent to a people of criminals
to send down upon them stones of clay
marked in the presence of your lord for the transgressors
so we brought out whoever was in the cities of the believers
and we found not within them other than a single house of muslims
and we left therein a sign for those who fear the painful punishment
and in moses was a sign when we sent him to pharaoh with clear authority
but he turned away with his supporters and said a magician or a madman
so we took him and his soldiers and cast them into the sea and he was blameworthy
and in aad was a sign when we sent against them the barren wind
it left nothing of what it came upon but that it made it like disintegrated ruins
and in thamud when it was said to them enjoy yourselves for a time
but they were insolent toward the command of their lord so the thunderbolt seized them while they were looking on
and they were unable to arise nor could they defend themselves
and we destroyed the people of noah before indeed they were a people defiantly disobedient
and the heaven we constructed with strength and indeed we are its expander
and the earth we have spread out and excellent is the preparer
and of all things we created two mates perhaps you will remember
so flee to allah indeed i am to you from him a clear warner
and do not make as equal with allah another deity indeed i am to you from him a clear warner
similarly there came not to those before them any messenger except that they said a magician or a madman
did they suggest it to them rather they themselves are a transgressing people
so leave them o muhammad for you are not to be blamed
and remind for indeed the reminder benefits the believers
and i did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship me
i do not want from them any provision nor do i want them to feed me
indeed it is allah who is the continual provider the firm possessor of strength
and indeed for those who have wronged is a portion of punishment like the portion of their predecessors so let them not impatiently urge me
and woe to those who have disbelieved from their day which they are promised
by the mount
and by a book inscribed
in parchment spread open
and by the frequented house
and by the heaven raised high
and by the sea filled with fire
indeed the punishment of your lord will occur
of it there is no preventer
on the day the heaven will sway with circular motion
and the mountains will pass on departing
then woe that day to the deniers
who are in empty discourse amusing themselves
the day they are thrust toward the fire of hell with a violent thrust its angels will say
this is the fire which you used to deny
then is this magic or do you not see
enter to burn therein then be patient or impatient it is all the same for you you are only being recompensed for what you used to do
indeed the righteous will be in gardens and pleasure
enjoying what their lord has given them and their lord protected them from the punishment of hellfire
they will be told eat and drink in satisfaction for what you used to do
they will be reclining on thrones lined up and we will marry them to fair women with large beautiful eyes
and those who believed and whose descendants followed them in faith we will join with them their descendants and we will not deprive them of anything of their deeds every person for what he earned is retained
and we will provide them with fruit and meat from whatever they desire
they will exchange with one another a cup of wine wherein results no ill speech or commission of sin
there will circulate among them servant boys especially for them as if they were pearls well protected
and they will approach one another inquiring of each other
they will say indeed we were previously among our people fearful of displeasing allah
so allah conferred favor upon us and protected us from the punishment of the scorching fire
indeed we used to supplicate him before indeed it is he who is the beneficent the merciful
so remind o muhammad for you are not by the favor of your lord a soothsayer or a madman
or do they say of you a poet for whom we await a misfortune of time
say wait for indeed i am with you among the waiters
or do their minds command them to say this or are they a transgressing people
or do they say he has made it up rather they do not believe
then let them produce a statement like it if they should be truthful
or were they created by nothing or were they the creators of themselves
or did they create the heavens and the earth rather they are not certain
or have they the depositories containing the provision of your lord or are they the controllers of them
or have they a stairway into the heaven upon which they listen then let their listener produce a clear authority
or has he daughters while you have sons
or do you o muhammad ask of them a payment so they are by debt burdened down
or have they knowledge of the unseen so they write it down
or do they intend a plan but those who disbelieve they are the object of a plan
or have they a deity other than allah exalted is allah above whatever they associate with him
and if they were to see a fragment from the sky falling they would say it is merely clouds heaped up
so leave them until they meet their day in which they will be struck insensible
the day their plan will not avail them at all nor will they be helped
and indeed for those who have wronged is a punishment before that but most of them do not know
and be patient o muhammad for the decision of your lord for indeed you are in our eyes and exalt allah with praise of your lord when you arise
and in a part of the night exalt him and after the setting of the stars
by the star when it descends
your companion muhammad has not strayed nor has he erred
nor does he speak from his own inclination
it is not but a revelation revealed
taught to him by one intense in strength
one of soundness and he rose to his true form
while he was in the higher part of the horizon
then he approached and descended
and was at a distance of two bow lengths or nearer
and he revealed to his servant what he revealed
the heart did not lie about what it saw
so will you dispute with him over what he saw
and he certainly saw him in another descent
at the lote tree of the utmost boundary
near it is the garden of refuge
when there covered the lote tree that which covered it
the sight of the prophet did not swerve nor did it transgress its limit
he certainly saw of the greatest signs of his lord
so have you considered al lat and al uzza
and manat the third the other one
is the male for you and for him the female
that then is an unjust division
they are not but mere names you have named them you and your forefathers for which allah has sent down no authority they follow not except assumption and what their souls desire and there has already come to them from their lord guidance
or is there for man whatever he wishes
rather to allah belongs the hereafter and the first life
and how many angels there are in the heavens whose intercession will not avail at all except only after allah has permitted it to whom he wills and approves
indeed those who do not believe in the hereafter name the angels female names
and they have thereof no knowledge they follow not except assumption and indeed assumption avails not against the truth at all
so turn away from whoever turns his back on our message and desires not except the worldly life
that is their sum of knowledge indeed your lord is most knowing of who strays from his way and he is most knowing of who is guided
and to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth that he may recompense those who do evil with the penalty of what they have done and recompense those who do good with the best reward
those who avoid the major sins and immoralities only committing slight ones indeed your lord is vast in forgiveness he was most knowing of you when he produced you from the earth and when you were fetuses in the wombs of your mothers so do not claim yourselves to be pure he is most knowing of who fears him
have you seen the one who turned away
and gave a little and then refrained
does he have knowledge of the unseen so he sees
or has he not been informed of what was in the scriptures of moses
and of abraham who fulfilled his obligations
that no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another
and that there is not for man except that good for which he strives
and that his effort is going to be seen
then he will be recompensed for it with the fullest recompense
and that to your lord is the finality
and that it is he who makes one laugh and weep
and that it is he who causes death and gives life
and that he creates the two mates the male and female
from a sperm drop when it is emitted
and that incumbent upon him is the next creation
and that it is he who enriches and suffices
and that it is he who is the lord of sirius
and that he destroyed the first people of aad
and thamud and he did not spare them
and the people of noah before indeed it was they who were even more unjust and oppressing
and the overturned towns he hurled down
and covered them by that which he covered
then which of the favors of your lord do you doubt
this prophet is a warner like the former warners
the approaching day has approached
of it from those besides allah there is no remover
then at this statement do you wonder
and you laugh and do not weep
while you are proudly sporting
so prostrate to allah and worship him
the hour has come near and the moon has split in two
and if they see a miracle they turn away and say passing magic
and they denied and followed their inclinations but for every matter is a time of settlement
and there has already come to them of information that in which there is deterrence
extensive wisdom but warning does not avail them
so leave them o muhammad the day the caller calls to something forbidding
their eyes humbled they will emerge from the graves as if they were locusts spreading
racing ahead toward the caller the disbelievers will say this is a difficult day
the people of noah denied before them and they denied our servant and said a madman and he was repelled
so he invoked his lord indeed i am overpowered so help
then we opened the gates of the heaven with rain pouring down
and caused the earth to burst with springs and the waters met for a matter already predestined
and we carried him on a construction of planks and nails
sailing under our observation as reward for he who had been denied
and we left it as a sign so is there any who will remember
and how severe were my punishment and warning
and we have certainly made the qur an easy for remembrance so is there any who will remember
aad denied and how severe were my punishment and warning
indeed we sent upon them a screaming wind on a day of continuous misfortune
extracting the people as if they were trunks of palm trees uprooted
and how severe were my punishment and warning
and we have certainly made the qur an easy for remembrance so is there any who will remember
thamud denied the warning
and said is it one human being among us that we should follow indeed we would then be in error and madness
has the message been sent down upon him from among us rather he is an insolent liar
they will know tomorrow who is the insolent liar
indeed we are sending the she camel as trial for them so watch them and be patient
and inform them that the water is shared between them each day of drink attended by turn
but they called their companion and he dared and hamstrung her
and how severe were my punishment and warning
indeed we sent upon them one blast from the sky and they became like the dry twig fragments of an animal pen
and we have certainly made the qur an easy for remembrance so is there any who will remember
the people of lot denied the warning
indeed we sent upon them a storm of stones except the family of lot we saved them before dawn
as favor from us thus do we reward he who is grateful
and he had already warned them of our assault but they disputed the warning
and they had demanded from him his guests but we obliterated their eyes saying taste my punishment and warning
and there came upon them by morning an abiding punishment
so taste my punishment and warning
and we have certainly made the qur an easy for remembrance so is there any who will remember
and there certainly came to the people of pharaoh warning
they denied our signs all of them so we seized them with a seizure of one exalted in might and perfect in ability
are your disbelievers better than those former ones or have you immunity in the scripture
or do they say we are an assembly supporting each other
their assembly will be defeated and they will turn their backs in retreat
but the hour is their appointment for due punishment and the hour is more disastrous and more bitter
indeed the criminals are in error and madness
the day they are dragged into the fire on their faces it will be said taste the touch of saqar
indeed all things we created with predestination
and our command is but one like a glance of the eye
and we have already destroyed your kinds so is there any who will remember
and everything they did is in written records
and every small and great thing is inscribed
indeed the righteous will be among gardens and rivers
in a seat of honor near a sovereign perfect in ability
the most merciful
taught the qur an
created man
and taught him eloquence
the sun and the moon move by precise calculation
and the stars and trees prostrate
and the heaven he raised and imposed the balance
that you not transgress within the balance
and establish weight in justice and do not make deficient the balance
and the earth he laid out for the creatures
therein is fruit and palm trees having sheaths of dates
and grain having husks and scented plants
so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
he created man from clay like that of pottery
and he created the jinn from a smokeless flame of fire
so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
he is lord of the two sunrises and lord of the two sunsets
so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
he released the two seas meeting side by side
between them is a barrier so neither of them transgresses
so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
from both of them emerge pearl and coral
so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
and to him belong the ships with sails elevated in the sea like mountains
so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
everyone upon the earth will perish
and there will remain the face of your lord owner of majesty and honor
so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
whoever is within the heavens and earth asks him every day he is bringing about a matter
so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
we will attend to you o prominent beings
so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
o company of jinn and mankind if you are able to pass beyond the regions of the heavens and the earth then pass you will not pass except by authority from allah
so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
there will be sent upon you a flame of fire and smoke and you will not defend yourselves
so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
and when the heaven is split open and becomes rose colored like oil
so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
then on that day none will be asked about his sin among men or jinn
so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
the criminals will be known by their marks and they will be seized by the forelocks and the feet
so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
this is hell which the criminals deny
they will go around between it and scalding water heated to the utmost degree
so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
but for he who has feared the position of his lord are two gardens
so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
having spreading branches
so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
in both of them are two springs flowing
so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
in both of them are of every fruit two kinds
so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
they are reclining on beds whose linings are of silk brocade and the fruit of the two gardens is hanging low
so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
in them are women limiting their glances untouched before them by man or jinni
so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
as if they were rubies and coral
so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
is the reward for good anything but good
so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
and below them both in excellence are two other gardens
so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
dark green in color
so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
in both of them are two springs spouting
so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
in both of them are fruit and palm trees and pomegranates
so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
in them are good and beautiful women
so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
fair ones reserved in pavilions
so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
untouched before them by man or jinni
so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
reclining on green cushions and beautiful fine carpets
so which of the favors of your lord would you deny
blessed is the name of your lord owner of majesty and honor
when the occurrence occurs
there is at its occurrence no denial
it will bring down some and raise up others
when the earth is shaken with convulsion
and the mountains are broken down crumbling
and become dust dispersing
and you become of three kinds
then the companions of the right what are the companions of the right
and the companions of the left what are the companions of the left
and the forerunners the forerunners
those are the ones brought near to allah
in the gardens of pleasure
a large company of the former peoples
and a few of the later peoples
on thrones woven with ornament
reclining on them facing each other
there will circulate among them young boys made eternal
with vessels pitchers and a cup of wine from a flowing spring
no headache will they have therefrom nor will they be intoxicated
and fruit of what they select
and the meat of fowl from whatever they desire
and for them are fair women with large beautiful eyes
the likenesses of pearls well protected
as reward for what they used to do
they will not hear therein ill speech or commission of sin
only a saying peace peace
the companions of the right what are the companions of the right
they will be among lote trees with thorns removed
and banana trees layered with fruit
and shade extended
and water poured out
and fruit abundant and varied
neither limited to season nor forbidden
and upon beds raised high
indeed we have produced the women of paradise in a new creation
and made them virgins
devoted to their husbands and of equal age
for the companions of the right who are
a company of the former peoples
and a company of the later peoples
and the companions of the left what are the companions of the left
they will be in scorching fire and scalding water
and a shade of black smoke
neither cool nor beneficial
indeed they were before that indulging in affluence
and they used to persist in the great violation
and they used to say when we die and become dust and bones are we indeed to be resurrected
and our forefathers as well
say o muhammad indeed the former and the later peoples
are to be gathered together for the appointment of a known day
then indeed you o those astray who are deniers
will be eating from trees of zaqqum
and filling with it your bellies
and drinking on top of it from scalding water
and will drink as the drinking of thirsty camels
that is their accommodation on the day of recompense
we have created you so why do you not believe
have you seen that which you emit
is it you who creates it or are we the creator
we have decreed death among you and we are not to be outdone
in that we will change your likenesses and produce you in that form which you do not know
and you have already known the first creation so will you not remember
and have you seen that seed which you sow
is it you who makes it grow or are we the grower
if we willed we could make it dry debris and you would remain in wonder
saying indeed we are now in debt
rather we have been deprived
and have you seen the water that you drink
is it you who brought it down from the clouds or is it we who bring it down
if we willed we could make it bitter so why are you not grateful
and have you seen the fire that you ignite
is it you who produced its tree or are we the producer
we have made it a reminder and provision for the travelers
so exalt the name of your lord the most great
then i swear by the setting of the stars
and indeed it is an oath if you could know most great
indeed it is a noble qur an
in a register well protected
none touch it except the purified
it is a revelation from the lord of the worlds
then is it to this statement that you are indifferent
and make the thanks for your provision that you deny the provider
then why when the soul at death reaches the throat
and you are at that time looking on
and our angels are nearer to him than you but you do not see
then why do you not if you are not to be recompensed
bring it back if you should be truthful
and if the deceased was of those brought near to allah
then for him is rest and bounty and a garden of pleasure
and if he was of the companions of the right
then the angels will say peace for you you are from the companions of the right
but if he was of the deniers who were astray
then for him is accommodation of scalding water
and burning in hellfire
indeed this is the true certainty
so exalt the name of your lord the most great
whatever is in the heavens and earth exalts allah and he is the exalted in might the wise
his is the dominion of the heavens and earth he gives life and causes death and he is over all things competent
he is the first and the last the ascendant and the intimate and he is of all things knowing
it is he who created the heavens and earth in six days and then established himself above the throne he knows what penetrates into the earth and what emerges from it and what descends from the heaven and what ascends therein and he is with you wherever you are and allah of what you do is seeing
his is the dominion of the heavens and earth and to allah are returned all matters
he causes the night to enter the day and causes the day to enter the night and he is knowing of that within the breasts
believe in allah and his messenger and spend out of that in which he has made you successors for those who have believed among you and spent there will be a great reward
and why do you not believe in allah while the messenger invites you to believe in your lord and he has taken your covenant if you should truly be believers
it is he who sends down upon his servant muhammad verses of clear evidence that he may bring you out from darknesses into the light and indeed allah is to you kind and merciful
and why do you not spend in the cause of allah while to allah belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth not equal among you are those who spent before the conquest of makkah and fought and those who did so after it those are greater in degree than they who spent afterwards and fought but to all allah has promised the best reward and allah with what you do is acquainted
who is it that would loan allah a goodly loan so he will multiply it for him and he will have a noble reward
on the day you see the believing men and believing women their light proceeding before them and on their right it will be said your good tidings today are of gardens beneath which rivers flow wherein you will abide eternally that is what is the great attainment
on the same day the hypocrite men and hypocrite women will say to those who believed wait for us that we may acquire some of your light it will be said go back behind you and seek light and a wall will be placed between them with a door its interior containing mercy but on the outside of it is torment
the hypocrites will call to the believers were we not with you they will say yes but you afflicted yourselves and awaited misfortune for us and doubted and wishful thinking deluded you until there came the command of allah and the deceiver deceived you concerning allah
so today no ransom will be taken from you or from those who disbelieved your refuge is the fire it is most worthy of you and wretched is the destination
has the time not come for those who have believed that their hearts should become humbly submissive at the remembrance of allah and what has come down of the truth and let them not be like those who were given the scripture before and a long period passed over them so their hearts hardened and many of them are defiantly disobedient
know that allah gives life to the earth after its lifelessness we have made clear to you the signs perhaps you will understand
indeed the men who practice charity and the women who practice charity and they who have loaned allah a goodly loan it will be multiplied for them and they will have a noble reward
and those who have believed in allah and his messengers those are in the ranks of the supporters of truth and the martyrs with their lord for them is their reward and their light but those who have disbelieved and denied our verses those are the companions of hellfire
know that the life of this world is but amusement and diversion and adornment and boasting to one another and competition in increase of wealth and children like the example of a rain whose resulting plant growth pleases the tillers then it dries and you see it turned yellow then it becomes scattered debris and in the hereafter is severe punishment and forgiveness from allah and approval and what is the worldly life except the enjoyment of delusion
race toward forgiveness from your lord and a garden whose width is like the width of the heavens and earth prepared for those who believed in allah and his messengers that is the bounty of allah which he gives to whom he wills and allah is the possessor of great bounty
no disaster strikes upon the earth or among yourselves except that it is in a register before we bring it into being indeed that for allah is easy
in order that you not despair over what has eluded you and not exult in pride over what he has given you and allah does not like everyone self deluded and boastful
those who are stingy and enjoin upon people stinginess and whoever turns away then indeed allah is the free of need the praiseworthy
we have already sent our messengers with clear evidences and sent down with them the scripture and the balance that the people may maintain their affairs in justice and we sent down iron wherein is great military might and benefits for the people and so that allah may make evident those who support him and his messengers unseen indeed allah is powerful and exalted in might
and we have already sent noah and abraham and placed in their descendants prophethood and scripture and among them is he who is guided but many of them are defiantly disobedient
then we sent following their footsteps our messengers and followed them with jesus the son of mary and gave him the gospel and we placed in the hearts of those who followed him compassion and mercy and monasticism which they innovated we did not prescribe it for them except that they did so seeking the approval of allah but they did not observe it with due observance so we gave the ones who believed among them their reward but many of them are defiantly disobedient
o you who have believed fear allah and believe in his messenger he will then give you a double portion of his mercy and make for you a light by which you will walk and forgive you and allah is forgiving and merciful
this is so that the people of the scripture may know that they are not able to obtain anything from the bounty of allah and that all bounty is in the hand of allah he gives it to whom he wills and allah is the possessor of great bounty
certainly has allah heard the speech of the one who argues with you o muhammad concerning her husband and directs her complaint to allah and allah hears your dialogue indeed allah is hearing and seeing
those who pronounce thihar among you to separate from their wives they are not consequently their mothers their mothers are none but those who gave birth to them and indeed they are saying an objectionable statement and a falsehood but indeed allah is pardoning and forgiving
and those who pronounce thihar from their wives and then wish to go back on what they said then there must be the freeing of a slave before they touch one another that is what you are admonished thereby and allah is acquainted with what you do
and he who does not find a slave then a fast for two months consecutively before they touch one another and he who is unable then the feeding of sixty poor persons that is for you to believe completely in allah and his messenger and those are the limits set by allah and for the disbelievers is a painful punishment
indeed those who oppose allah and his messenger are abased as those before them were abased and we have certainly sent down verses of clear evidence and for the disbelievers is a humiliating punishment
on the day when allah will resurrect them all and inform them of what they did allah had enumerated it while they forgot it and allah is over all things witness
have you not considered that allah knows what is in the heavens and what is on the earth there is in no private conversation three but that he is the fourth of them nor are there five but that he is the sixth of them and no less than that and no more except that he is with them in knowledge wherever they are then he will inform them of what they did on the day of resurrection indeed allah is of all things knowing
have you not considered those who were forbidden from private conversation then they return to that which they were forbidden and converse among themselves about sin and aggression and disobedience to the messenger and when they come to you they greet you with that word by which allah does not greet you and say among themselves why does allah not punish us for what we say sufficient for them is hell which they will enter to burn and wretched is the destination
o you who have believed when you converse privately do not converse about sin and aggression and disobedience to the messenger but converse about righteousness and piety and fear allah to whom you will be gathered
private conversation is only from satan that he may grieve those who have believed but he will not harm them at all except by permission of allah and upon allah let the believers rely
o you who have believed when you are told space yourselves in assemblies then make space allah will make space for you and when you are told arise then arise allah will raise those who have believed among you and those who were given knowledge by degrees and allah is acquainted with what you do
o you who have believed when you wish to privately consult the messenger present before your consultation a charity that is better for you and purer but if you find not the means then indeed allah is forgiving and merciful
have you feared to present before your consultation charities then when you do not and allah has forgiven you then at least establish prayer and give zakah and obey allah and his messenger and allah is acquainted with what you do
have you not considered those who make allies of a people with whom allah has become angry they are neither of you nor of them and they swear to untruth while they know they are lying
allah has prepared for them a severe punishment indeed it was evil that they were doing
they took their false oaths as a cover so they averted people from the way of allah and for them is a humiliating punishment
never will their wealth or their children avail them against allah at all those are the companions of the fire they will abide therein eternally
on the day allah will resurrect them all and they will swear to him as they swear to you and think that they are standing on something unquestionably it is they who are the liars
satan has overcome them and made them forget the remembrance of allah those are the party of satan unquestionably the party of satan they will be the losers
indeed the ones who oppose allah and his messenger those will be among the most humbled
allah has written i will surely overcome i and my messengers indeed allah is powerful and exalted in might
you will not find a people who believe in allah and the last day having affection for those who oppose allah and his messenger even if they were their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kindred those he has decreed within their hearts faith and supported them with spirit from him and we will admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow wherein they abide eternally allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with him those are the party of allah unquestionably the party of allah they are the successful
whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth exalts allah and he is the exalted in might the wise
it is he who expelled the ones who disbelieved among the people of the scripture from their homes at the first gathering you did not think they would leave and they thought that their fortresses would protect them from allah but the decree of allah came upon them from where they had not expected and he cast terror into their hearts so they destroyed their houses by their own hands and the hands of the believers so take warning o people of vision
and if not that allah had decreed for them evacuation he would have punished them in this world and for them in the hereafter is the punishment of the fire
that is because they opposed allah and his messenger and whoever opposes allah then indeed allah is severe in penalty
whatever you have cut down of their palm trees or left standing on their trunks it was by permission of allah and so he would disgrace the defiantly disobedient
and what allah restored of property to his messenger from them you did not spur for it in an expedition any horses or camels but allah gives his messengers power over whom he wills and allah is over all things competent
and what allah restored to his messenger from the people of the towns it is for allah and for the messenger and for his near relatives and orphans and the stranded traveler so that it will not be a perpetual distribution among the rich from among you and whatever the messenger has given you take and what he has forbidden you refrain from and fear allah indeed allah is severe in penalty
for the poor emigrants who were expelled from their homes and their properties seeking bounty from allah and his approval and supporting allah and his messenger there is also a share those are the truthful
and also for those who were settled in al madinah and adopted the faith before them they love those who emigrated to them and find not any want in their breasts of what the emigrants were given but give them preference over themselves even though they are in privation and whoever is protected from the stinginess of his soul it is those who will be the successful
and there is a share for those who came after them saying our lord forgive us and our brothers who preceded us in faith and put not in our hearts any resentment toward those who have believed our lord indeed you are kind and merciful
have you not considered those who practice hypocrisy saying to their brothers who have disbelieved among the people of the scripture if you are expelled we will surely leave with you and we will not obey in regard to you anyone ever and if you are fought we will surely aid you but allah testifies that they are liars
if they are expelled they will not leave with them and if they are fought they will not aid them and even if they should aid them they will surely turn their backs then thereafter they will not be aided
you believers are more fearful within their breasts than allah that is because they are a people who do not understand
they will not fight you all except within fortified cities or from behind walls their violence among themselves is severe you think they are together but their hearts are diverse that is because they are a people who do not reason
theirs is like the example of those shortly before them they tasted the bad consequence of their affair and they will have a painful punishment
the hypocrites are like the example of satan when he says to man disbelieve but when he disbelieves he says indeed i am disassociated from you indeed i fear allah lord of the worlds
so the outcome for both of them is that they will be in the fire abiding eternally therein and that is the recompense of the wrong doers
o you who have believed fear allah and let every soul look to what it has put forth for tomorrow and fear allah indeed allah is acquainted with what you do
and be not like those who forgot allah so he made them forget themselves those are the defiantly disobedient
not equal are the companions of the fire and the companions of paradise the companions of paradise they are the attainers of success
if we had sent down this qur an upon a mountain you would have seen it humbled and coming apart from fear of allah and these examples we present to the people that perhaps they will give thought
he is allah other than whom there is no deity knower of the unseen and the witnessed he is the entirely merciful the especially merciful
he is allah other than whom there is no deity the sovereign the pure the perfection the bestower of faith the overseer the exalted in might the compeller the superior exalted is allah above whatever they associate with him
he is allah the creator the inventor the fashioner to him belong the best names whatever is in the heavens and earth is exalting him and he is the exalted in might the wise
o you who have believed do not take my enemies and your enemies as allies extending to them affection while they have disbelieved in what came to you of the truth having driven out the prophet and yourselves only because you believe in allah your lord if you have come out for jihad in my cause and seeking means to my approval take them not as friends you confide to them affection but i am most knowing of what you have concealed and what you have declared and whoever does it among you has certainly strayed from the soundness of the way
if they gain dominance over you they would be to you as enemies and extend against you their hands and their tongues with evil and they wish you would disbelieve
never will your relatives or your children benefit you the day of resurrection he will judge between you and allah of what you do is seeing
there has already been for you an excellent pattern in abraham and those with him when they said to their people indeed we are disassociated from you and from whatever you worship other than allah we have denied you and there has appeared between us and you animosity and hatred forever until you believe in allah alone except for the saying of abraham to his father i will surely ask forgiveness for you but i have not power to do for you anything against allah our lord upon you we have relied and to you we have returned and to you is the destination
our lord make us not objects of torment for the disbelievers and forgive us our lord indeed it is you who is the exalted in might the wise
there has certainly been for you in them an excellent pattern for anyone whose hope is in allah and the last day and whoever turns away then indeed allah is the free of need the praiseworthy
perhaps allah will put between you and those to whom you have been enemies among them affection and allah is competent and allah is forgiving and merciful
allah does not forbid you from those who do not fight you because of religion and do not expel you from your homes from being righteous toward them and acting justly toward them indeed allah loves those who act justly
allah only forbids you from those who fight you because of religion and expel you from your homes and aid in your expulsion forbids that you make allies of them and whoever makes allies of them then it is those who are the wrongdoers
o you who have believed when the believing women come to you as emigrants examine them allah is most knowing as to their faith and if you know them to be believers then do not return them to the disbelievers they are not lawful wives for them nor are they lawful husbands for them but give the disbelievers what they have spent and there is no blame upon you if you marry them when you have given them their due compensation and hold not to marriage bonds with disbelieving women but ask for what you have spent and let them ask for what they have spent that is the judgement of allah he judges between you and allah is knowing and wise
and if you have lost any of your wives to the disbelievers and you subsequently obtain something then give those whose wives have gone the equivalent of what they had spent and fear allah in whom you are believers
o prophet when the believing women come to you pledging to you that they will not associate anything with allah nor will they steal nor will they commit unlawful sexual intercourse nor will they kill their children nor will they bring forth a slander they have invented between their arms and legs nor will they disobey you in what is right then accept their pledge and ask forgiveness for them of allah indeed allah is forgiving and merciful
o you who have believed do not make allies of a people with whom allah has become angry they have despaired of reward in the hereafter just as the disbelievers have despaired of meeting the inhabitants of the graves
whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth exalts allah and he is the exalted in might the wise
o you who have believed why do you say what you do not do
great is hatred in the sight of allah that you say what you do not do
indeed allah loves those who fight in his cause in a row as though they are a single structure joined firmly
and mention o muhammad when moses said to his people o my people why do you harm me while you certainly know that i am the messenger of allah to you and when they deviated allah caused their hearts to deviate and allah does not guide the defiantly disobedient people
and mention when jesus the son of mary said o children of israel indeed i am the messenger of allah to you confirming what came before me of the torah and bringing good tidings of a messenger to come after me whose name is ahmad but when he came to them with clear evidences they said this is obvious magic
and who is more unjust than one who invents about allah untruth while he is being invited to islam and allah does not guide the wrongdoing people
they want to extinguish the light of allah with their mouths but allah will perfect his light although the disbelievers dislike it
it is he who sent his messenger with guidance and the religion of truth to manifest it over all religion although those who associate others with allah dislike it
o you who have believed shall i guide you to a transaction that will save you from a painful punishment
it is that you believe in allah and his messenger and strive in the cause of allah with your wealth and your lives that is best for you if you should know
he will forgive for you your sins and admit you to gardens beneath which rivers flow and pleasant dwellings in gardens of perpetual residence that is the great attainment
and you will obtain another favor that you love victory from allah and an imminent conquest and give good tidings to the believers
o you who have believed be supporters of allah as when jesus the son of mary said to the disciples who are my supporters for allah the disciples said we are supporters of allah and a faction of the children of israel believed and a faction disbelieved so we supported those who believed against their enemy and they became dominant
whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth is exalting allah the sovereign the pure the exalted in might the wise
it is he who has sent among the unlettered a messenger from themselves reciting to them his verses and purifying them and teaching them the book and wisdom although they were before in clear error
and to others of them who have not yet joined them and he is the exalted in might the wise
that is the bounty of allah which he gives to whom he wills and allah is the possessor of great bounty
the example of those who were entrusted with the torah and then did not take it on is like that of a donkey who carries volumes of books wretched is the example of the people who deny the signs of allah and allah does not guide the wrongdoing people
say o you who are jews if you claim that you are allies of allah excluding the other people then wish for death if you should be truthful
but they will not wish for it ever because of what their hands have put forth and allah is knowing of the wrongdoers
say indeed the death from which you flee indeed it will meet you then you will be returned to the knower of the unseen and the witnessed and he will inform you about what you used to do
o you who have believed when the adhan is called for the prayer on the day of jumu ah friday then proceed to the remembrance of allah and leave trade that is better for you if you only knew
and when the prayer has been concluded disperse within the land and seek from the bounty of allah and remember allah often that you may succeed
but when they saw a transaction or a diversion o muhammad they rushed to it and left you standing say what is with allah is better than diversion and than a transaction and allah is the best of providers
when the hypocrites come to you o muhammad they say we testify that you are the messenger of allah and allah knows that you are his messenger and allah testifies that the hypocrites are liars
they have taken their oaths as a cover so they averted people from the way of allah indeed it was evil that they were doing
that is because they believed and then they disbelieved so their hearts were sealed over and they do not understand
and when you see them their forms please you and if they speak you listen to their speech they are as if they were pieces of wood propped up they think that every shout is against them they are the enemy so beware of them may allah destroy them how are they deluded
and when it is said to them come the messenger of allah will ask forgiveness for you they turn their heads aside and you see them evading while they are arrogant
it is all the same for them whether you ask forgiveness for them or do not ask forgiveness for them never will allah forgive them indeed allah does not guide the defiantly disobedient people
they are the ones who say do not spend on those who are with the messenger of allah until they disband and to allah belongs the depositories of the heavens and the earth but the hypocrites do not understand
they say if we return to al madinah the more honored for power will surely expel therefrom the more humble and to allah belongs all honor and to his messenger and to the believers but the hypocrites do not know
o you who have believed let not your wealth and your children divert you from remembrance of allah and whoever does that then those are the losers
and spend in the way of allah from what we have provided you before death approaches one of you and he says my lord if only you would delay me for a brief term so i would give charity and be among the righteous
but never will allah delay a soul when its time has come and allah is acquainted with what you do
whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth is exalting allah to him belongs dominion and to him belongs all praise and he is over all things competent
it is he who created you and among you is the disbeliever and among you is the believer and allah of what you do is seeing
he created the heavens and earth in truth and formed you and perfected your forms and to him is the final destination
he knows what is within the heavens and earth and knows what you conceal and what you declare and allah is knowing of that within the breasts
has there not come to you the news of those who disbelieved before so they tasted the bad consequence of their affair and they will have a painful punishment
that is because their messengers used to come to them with clear evidences but they said shall human beings guide us and disbelieved and turned away and allah dispensed with them and allah is free of need and praiseworthy
those who disbelieve have claimed that they will never be resurrected say yes by my lord you will surely be resurrected then you will surely be informed of what you did and that for allah is easy
so believe in allah and his messenger and the qur an which we have sent down and allah is acquainted with what you do
the day he will assemble you for the day of assembly that is the day of deprivation and whoever believes in allah and does righteousness he will remove from him his misdeeds and admit him to gardens beneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide forever that is the great attainment
but the ones who disbelieved and denied our verses those are the companions of the fire abiding eternally therein and wretched is the destination
no disaster strikes except by permission of allah and whoever believes in allah he will guide his heart and allah is knowing of all things
and obey allah and obey the messenger but if you turn away then upon our messenger is only the duty of clear notification
allah there is no deity except him and upon allah let the believers rely
o you who have believed indeed among your wives and your children are enemies to you so beware of them but if you pardon and overlook and forgive then indeed allah is forgiving and merciful
your wealth and your children are but a trial and allah has with him a great reward
so fear allah as much as you are able and listen and obey and spend in the way of allah it is better for your selves and whoever is protected from the stinginess of his soul it is those who will be the successful
if you loan allah a goodly loan he will multiply it for you and forgive you and allah is most appreciative and forbearing
knower of the unseen and the witnessed the exalted in might the wise
o prophet when you muslims divorce women divorce them for the commencement of their waiting period and keep count of the waiting period and fear allah your lord do not turn them out of their husbands houses nor should they themselves leave during that period unless they are committing a clear immorality and those are the limits set by allah and whoever transgresses the limits of allah has certainly wronged himself you know not perhaps allah will bring about after that a different matter
and when they have nearly fulfilled their term either retain them according to acceptable terms or part with them according to acceptable terms and bring to witness two just men from among you and establish the testimony for the acceptance of allah that is instructed to whoever should believe in allah and the last day and whoever fears allah he will make for him a way out
and will provide for him from where he does not expect and whoever relies upon allah then he is sufficient for him indeed allah will accomplish his purpose allah has already set for everything a decreed extent
and those who no longer expect menstruation among your women if you doubt then their period is three months and also for those who have not menstruated and for those who are pregnant their term is until they give birth and whoever fears allah he will make for him of his matter ease
that is the command of allah which he has sent down to you and whoever fears allah he will remove for him his misdeeds and make great for him his reward
lodge them in a section of where you dwell out of your means and do not harm them in order to oppress them and if they should be pregnant then spend on them until they give birth and if they breastfeed for you then give them their payment and confer among yourselves in the acceptable way but if you are in discord then there may breastfeed for the father another woman
let a man of wealth spend from his wealth and he whose provision is restricted let him spend from what allah has given him allah does not charge a soul except according to what he has given it allah will bring about after hardship ease
and how many a city was insolent toward the command of its lord and his messengers so we took it to severe account and punished it with a terrible punishment
and it tasted the bad consequence of its affair and the outcome of its affair was loss
allah has prepared for them a severe punishment so fear allah o you of understanding who have believed allah has sent down to you the qur an
he sent a messenger muhammad reciting to you the distinct verses of allah that he may bring out those who believe and do righteous deeds from darknesses into the light and whoever believes in allah and does righteousness he will admit him into gardens beneath which rivers flow to abide therein forever allah will have perfected for him a provision
it is allah who has created seven heavens and of the earth the like of them his command descends among them so you may know that allah is over all things competent and that allah has encompassed all things in knowledge
o prophet why do you prohibit yourself from what allah has made lawful for you seeking the approval of your wives and allah is forgiving and merciful
allah has already ordained for you muslims the dissolution of your oaths and allah is your protector and he is the knowing the wise
and remember when the prophet confided to one of his wives a statement and when she informed another of it and allah showed it to him he made known part of it and ignored a part and when he informed her about it she said who told you this he said i was informed by the knowing the acquainted
if you two wives repent to allah it is best for your hearts have deviated but if you cooperate against him then indeed allah is his protector and gabriel and the righteous of the believers and the angels moreover are his assistants
perhaps his lord if he divorced you all would substitute for him wives better than you submitting to allah believing devoutly obedient repentant worshipping and traveling ones previously married and virgins
o you who have believed protect yourselves and your families from a fire whose fuel is people and stones over which are appointed angels harsh and severe they do not disobey allah in what he commands them but do what they are commanded
o you who have disbelieved make no excuses that day you will only be recompensed for what you used to do
o you who have believed repent to allah with sincere repentance perhaps your lord will remove from you your misdeeds and admit you into gardens beneath which rivers flow on the day when allah will not disgrace the prophet and those who believed with him their light will proceed before them and on their right they will say our lord perfect for us our light and forgive us indeed you are over all things competent
o prophet strive against the disbelievers and the hypocrites and be harsh upon them and their refuge is hell and wretched is the destination
allah presents an example of those who disbelieved the wife of noah and the wife of lot they were under two of our righteous servants but betrayed them so those prophets did not avail them from allah at all and it was said enter the fire with those who enter
and allah presents an example of those who believed the wife of pharaoh when she said my lord build for me near you a house in paradise and save me from pharaoh and his deeds and save me from the wrongdoing people
and the example of mary the daughter of imran who guarded her chastity so we blew into her garment through our angel and she believed in the words of her lord and his scriptures and was of the devoutly obedient
blessed is he in whose hand is dominion and he is over all things competent
he who created death and life to test you as to which of you is best in deed and he is the exalted in might the forgiving
and who created seven heavens in layers you do not see in the creation of the most merciful any inconsistency so return your vision to the sky do you see any breaks
then return your vision twice again your vision will return to you humbled while it is fatigued
and we have certainly beautified the nearest heaven with stars and have made from them what is thrown at the devils and have prepared for them the punishment of the blaze
and for those who disbelieved in their lord is the punishment of hell and wretched is the destination
when they are thrown into it they hear from it a dreadful inhaling while it boils up
it almost bursts with rage every time a company is thrown into it its keepers ask them did there not come to you a warner
they will say yes a warner had come to us but we denied and said allah has not sent down anything you are not but in great error
and they will say if only we had been listening or reasoning we would not be among the companions of the blaze
and they will admit their sin so it is alienation for the companions of the blaze
indeed those who fear their lord unseen will have forgiveness and great reward
and conceal your speech or publicize it indeed he is knowing of that within the breasts
does he who created not know while he is the subtle the acquainted
it is he who made the earth tame for you so walk among its slopes and eat of his provision and to him is the resurrection
do you feel secure that he who holds authority in the heaven would not cause the earth to swallow you and suddenly it would sway
or do you feel secure that he who holds authority in the heaven would not send against you a storm of stones then you would know how severe was my warning
and already had those before them denied and how terrible was my reproach
do they not see the birds above them with wings outspread and sometimes folded in none holds them aloft except the most merciful indeed he is of all things seeing
or who is it that could be an army for you to aid you other than the most merciful the disbelievers are not but in delusion
or who is it that could provide for you if he withheld his provision but they have persisted in insolence and aversion
then is one who walks fallen on his face better guided or one who walks erect on a straight path
say it is he who has produced you and made for you hearing and vision and hearts little are you grateful
say it is he who has multiplied you throughout the earth and to him you will be gathered
and they say when is this promise if you should be truthful
say the knowledge is only with allah and i am only a clear warner
but when they see it approaching the faces of those who disbelieve will be distressed and it will be said this is that for which you used to call
say o muhammad have you considered whether allah should cause my death and those with me or have mercy upon us who can protect the disbelievers from a painful punishment
say he is the most merciful we have believed in him and upon him we have relied and you will come to know who it is that is in clear error
say have you considered if your water was to become sunken into the earth then who could bring you flowing water
nun by the pen and what they inscribe
you are not o muhammad by the favor of your lord a madman
and indeed for you is a reward uninterrupted
and indeed you are of a great moral character
so you will see and they will see
which of you is the afflicted by a devil
indeed your lord is most knowing of who has gone astray from his way and he is most knowing of the rightly guided
then do not obey the deniers
they wish that you would soften in your position so they would soften toward you
and do not obey every worthless habitual swearer
and scorner going about with malicious gossip
a preventer of good transgressing and sinful
cruel moreover and an illegitimate pretender
because he is a possessor of wealth and children
when our verses are recited to him he says legends of the former peoples
we will brand him upon the snout
indeed we have tried them as we tried the companions of the garden when they swore to cut its fruit in the early morning
without making exception
so there came upon the garden an affliction from your lord while they were asleep
and it became as though reaped
and they called one another at morning
saying go early to your crop if you would cut the fruit
so they set out while lowering their voices
saying there will surely not enter it today upon you any poor person
and they went early in determination assuming themselves able
but when they saw it they said indeed we are lost
rather we have been deprived
the most moderate of them said did i not say to you why do you not exalt allah
they said exalted is our lord indeed we were wrongdoers
then they approached one another blaming each other
they said o woe to us indeed we were transgressors
perhaps our lord will substitute for us one better than it indeed we are toward our lord desirous
such is the punishment of this world and the punishment of the hereafter is greater if they only knew
indeed for the righteous with their lord are the gardens of pleasure
then will we treat the muslims like the criminals
what is the matter with you how do you judge
or do you have a scripture in which you learn
that indeed for you is whatever you choose
or do you have oaths binding upon us extending until the day of resurrection that indeed for you is whatever you judge
ask them which of them for that claim is responsible
or do they have partners then let them bring their partners if they should be truthful
the day the shin will be uncovered and they are invited to prostration but the disbelievers will not be able
their eyes humbled humiliation will cover them and they used to be invited to prostration while they were sound
so leave me o muhammad with the matter of whoever denies the qur an we will progressively lead them to punishment from where they do not know
and i will give them time indeed my plan is firm
or do you ask of them a payment so they are by debt burdened down
or have they knowledge of the unseen so they write it down
then be patient for the decision of your lord o muhammad and be not like the companion of the fish when he called out while he was distressed
if not that a favor from his lord overtook him he would have been thrown onto the naked shore while he was censured
and his lord chose him and made him of the righteous
and indeed those who disbelieve would almost make you slip with their eyes when they hear the message and they say indeed he is mad
but it is not except a reminder to the worlds
the inevitable reality
what is the inevitable reality
and what can make you know what is the inevitable reality
thamud and aad denied the striking calamity
so as for thamud they were destroyed by the overpowering blast
and as for aad they were destroyed by a screaming violent wind
which allah imposed upon them for seven nights and eight days in succession so you would see the people therein fallen as if they were hollow trunks of palm trees
then do you see of them any remains
and there came pharaoh and those before him and the overturned cities with sin
and they disobeyed the messenger of their lord so he seized them with a seizure exceeding in severity
indeed when the water overflowed we carried your ancestors in the sailing ship
that we might make it for you a reminder and that a conscious ear would be conscious of it
then when the horn is blown with one blast
and the earth and the mountains are lifted and leveled with one blow
then on that day the resurrection will occur
and the heaven will split open for that day it is infirm
and the angels are at its edges and there will bear the throne of your lord above them that day eight of them
that day you will be exhibited for judgement not hidden among you is anything concealed
so as for he who is given his record in his right hand he will say here read my record
indeed i was certain that i would be meeting my account
so he will be in a pleasant life
in an elevated garden
its fruit to be picked hanging near
they will be told eat and drink in satisfaction for what you put forth in the days past
but as for he who is given his record in his left hand he will say oh i wish i had not been given my record
and had not known what is my account
i wish my death had been the decisive one
my wealth has not availed me
gone from me is my authority
allah will say seize him and shackle him
then into hellfire drive him
then into a chain whose length is seventy cubits insert him
indeed he did not used to believe in allah the most great
nor did he encourage the feeding of the poor
so there is not for him here this day any devoted friend
nor any food except from the discharge of wounds
none will eat it except the sinners
so i swear by what you see
and what you do not see
that indeed the qur an is the word of a noble messenger
and it is not the word of a poet little do you believe
nor the word of a soothsayer little do you remember
it is a revelation from the lord of the worlds
and if muhammad had made up about us some false sayings
we would have seized him by the right hand
then we would have cut from him the aorta
and there is no one of you who could prevent us from him
and indeed the qur an is a reminder for the righteous
and indeed we know that among you are deniers
and indeed it will be a cause of regret upon the disbelievers
and indeed it is the truth of certainty
so exalt the name of your lord the most great
a supplicant asked for a punishment bound to happen
to the disbelievers of it there is no preventer
it is from allah owner of the ways of ascent
the angels and the spirit will ascend to him during a day the extent of which is fifty thousand years
so be patient with gracious patience
indeed they see it as distant
but we see it as near
on the day the sky will be like murky oil
and the mountains will be like wool
and no friend will ask anything of a friend
they will be shown each other the criminal will wish that he could be ransomed from the punishment of that day by his children
and his wife and his brother
and his nearest kindred who shelter him
and whoever is on earth entirely so then it could save him
no indeed it is the flame of hell
a remover of exteriors
it invites he who turned his back on truth and went away from obedience
and collected wealth and hoarded
indeed mankind was created anxious
when evil touches him impatient
and when good touches him withholding of it
except the observers of prayer
those who are constant in their prayer
and those within whose wealth is a known right
for the petitioner and the deprived
and those who believe in the day of recompense
and those who are fearful of the punishment of their lord
indeed the punishment of their lord is not that from which one is safe
and those who guard their private parts
except from their wives or those their right hands possess for indeed they are not to be blamed
but whoever seeks beyond that then they are the transgressors
and those who are to their trusts and promises attentive
and those who are in their testimonies upright
and those who carefully maintain their prayer
they will be in gardens honored
so what is the matter with those who disbelieve hastening from before you o muhammad
to sit on your right and your left in separate groups
does every person among them aspire to enter a garden of pleasure
no indeed we have created them from that which they know
so i swear by the lord of all risings and settings that indeed we are able
to replace them with better than them and we are not to be outdone
so leave them to converse vainly and amuse themselves until they meet their day which they are promised
the day they will emerge from the graves rapidly as if they were toward an erected idol hastening
their eyes humbled humiliation will cover them that is the day which they had been promised
indeed we sent noah to his people saying warn your people before there comes to them a painful punishment
he said o my people indeed i am to you a clear warner
saying worship allah fear him and obey me
allah will forgive you of your sins and delay you for a specified term indeed the time set by allah when it comes will not be delayed if you only knew
he said my lord indeed i invited my people to truth night and day
but my invitation increased them not except in flight
and indeed every time i invited them that you may forgive them they put their fingers in their ears covered themselves with their garments persisted and were arrogant with great arrogance
then i invited them publicly
then i announced to them and also confided to them secretly
and said ask forgiveness of your lord indeed he is ever a perpetual forgiver
he will send rain from the sky upon you in continuing showers
and give you increase in wealth and children and provide for you gardens and provide for you rivers
what is the matter with you that you do not attribute to allah due grandeur
while he has created you in stages
do you not consider how allah has created seven heavens in layers
and made the moon therein a reflected light and made the sun a burning lamp
and allah has caused you to grow from the earth a progressive growth
then he will return you into it and extract you another extraction
and allah has made for you the earth an expanse
that you may follow therein roads of passage
noah said my lord indeed they have disobeyed me and followed him whose wealth and children will not increase him except in loss
and they conspired an immense conspiracy
and said never leave your gods and never leave wadd or suwa or yaghuth and ya uq and nasr
and already they have misled many and my lord do not increase the wrongdoers except in error
because of their sins they were drowned and put into the fire and they found not for themselves besides allah any helpers
and noah said my lord do not leave upon the earth from among the disbelievers an inhabitant
indeed if you leave them they will mislead your servants and not beget except every wicked one and confirmed disbeliever
my lord forgive me and my parents and whoever enters my house a believer and the believing men and believing women and do not increase the wrongdoers except in destruction
say o muhammad it has been revealed to me that a group of the jinn listened and said indeed we have heard an amazing qur an
it guides to the right course and we have believed in it and we will never associate with our lord anyone
and it teaches that exalted is the nobleness of our lord he has not taken a wife or a son
and that our foolish one has been saying about allah an excessive transgression
and we had thought that mankind and the jinn would never speak about allah a lie
and there were men from mankind who sought refuge in men from the jinn so they only increased them in burden
and they had thought as you thought that allah would never send anyone as a messenger
and we have sought to reach the heaven but found it filled with powerful guards and burning flames
and we used to sit therein in positions for hearing but whoever listens now will find a burning flame lying in wait for him
and we do not know therefore whether evil is intended for those on earth or whether their lord intends for them a right course
and among us are the righteous and among us are others not so we were of divided ways
and we have become certain that we will never cause failure to allah upon earth nor can we escape him by flight
and when we heard the guidance we believed in it and whoever believes in his lord will not fear deprivation or burden
and among us are muslims in submission to allah and among us are the unjust and whoever has become muslim those have sought out the right course
but as for the unjust they will be for hell firewood
and allah revealed that if they had remained straight on the way we would have given them abundant provision
so we might test them therein and whoever turns away from the remembrance of his lord he will put into arduous punishment
and he revealed that the masjids are for allah so do not invoke with allah anyone
and that when the servant of allah stood up supplicating him they almost became about him a compacted mass
say o muhammad i only invoke my lord and do not associate with him anyone
say indeed i do not possess for you the power of harm or right direction
say indeed there will never protect me from allah anyone if i should disobey nor will i find in other than him a refuge
but i have for you only notification from allah and his messages and whoever disobeys allah and his messenger then indeed for him is the fire of hell they will abide therein forever
the disbelievers continue until when they see that which they are promised then they will know who is weaker in helpers and less in number
say i do not know if what you are promised is near or if my lord will grant for it a long period
he is knower of the unseen and he does not disclose his knowledge of the unseen to anyone
except whom he has approved of messengers and indeed he sends before each messenger and behind him observers
that he may know that they have conveyed the messages of their lord and he has encompassed whatever is with them and has enumerated all things in number
o you who wraps himself in clothing
arise to pray the night except for a little
half of it or subtract from it a little
or add to it and recite the qur an with measured recitation
indeed we will cast upon you a heavy word
indeed the hours of the night are more effective for concurrence of heart and tongue and more suitable for words
indeed for you by day is prolonged occupation
and remember the name of your lord and devote yourself to him with complete devotion
he is the lord of the east and the west there is no deity except him so take him as disposer of your affairs
and be patient over what they say and avoid them with gracious avoidance
and leave me with the matter of the deniers those of ease in life and allow them respite a little
indeed with us for them are shackles and burning fire
and food that chokes and a painful punishment
on the day the earth and the mountains will convulse and the mountains will become a heap of sand pouring down
indeed we have sent to you a messenger as a witness upon you just as we sent to pharaoh a messenger
but pharaoh disobeyed the messenger so we seized him with a ruinous seizure
then how can you fear if you disbelieve a day that will make the children white haired
the heaven will break apart therefrom ever is his promise fulfilled
indeed this is a reminder so whoever wills may take to his lord a way
indeed your lord knows o muhammad that you stand in prayer almost two thirds of the night or half of it or a third of it and so do a group of those with you and allah determines the extent of the night and the day he has known that you muslims will not be able to do it and has turned to you in forgiveness so recite what is easy for you of the qur an he has known that there will be among you those who are ill and others traveling throughout the land seeking something of the bounty of allah and others fighting for the cause of allah so recite what is easy from it and establish prayer and give zakah and loan allah a goodly loan and whatever good you put forward for yourselves you will find it with allah it is better and greater in reward and seek forgiveness of allah indeed allah is forgiving and merciful
o you who covers himself with a garment
arise and warn
and your lord glorify
and your clothing purify
and uncleanliness avoid
and do not confer favor to acquire more
but for your lord be patient
and when the trumpet is blown
that day will be a difficult day
for the disbelievers not easy
leave me with the one i created alone
and to whom i granted extensive wealth
and children present with him
and spread everything before him easing his life
then he desires that i should add more
no indeed he has been toward our verses obstinate
i will cover him with arduous torment
indeed he thought and deliberated
so may he be destroyed for how he deliberated
then may he be destroyed for how he deliberated
then he considered again
then he frowned and scowled
then he turned back and was arrogant
and said this is not but magic imitated from others
this is not but the word of a human being
i will drive him into saqar
and what can make you know what is saqar
it lets nothing remain and leaves nothing unburned
blackening the skins
over it are nineteen angels
and we have not made the keepers of the fire except angels and we have not made their number except as a trial for those who disbelieve that those who were given the scripture will be convinced and those who have believed will increase in faith and those who were given the scripture and the believers will not doubt and that those in whose hearts is hypocrisy and the disbelievers will say what does allah intend by this as an example thus does allah leave astray whom he wills and guides whom he wills and none knows the soldiers of your lord except him and mention of the fire is not but a reminder to humanity
no by the moon
and by the night when it departs
and by the morning when it brightens
indeed the fire is of the greatest afflictions
as a warning to humanity
to whoever wills among you to proceed or stay behind
every soul for what it has earned will be retained
except the companions of the right
who will be in gardens questioning each other
about the criminals
and asking them what put you into saqar
they will say we were not of those who prayed
nor did we used to feed the poor
and we used to enter into vain discourse with those who engaged in it
and we used to deny the day of recompense
until there came to us the certainty
so there will not benefit them the intercession of any intercessors
then what is the matter with them that they are from the reminder turning away
as if they were alarmed donkeys
fleeing from a lion
rather every person among them desires that he would be given scriptures spread about
no but they do not fear the hereafter
no indeed the qur an is a reminder
then whoever wills will remember it
and they will not remember except that allah wills he is worthy of fear and adequate for granting forgiveness
i swear by the day of resurrection
and i swear by the reproaching soul to the certainty of resurrection
does man think that we will not assemble his bones
yes we are able even to proportion his fingertips
but man desires to continue in sin
he asks when is the day of resurrection
so when vision is dazzled
and the moon darkens
and the sun and the moon are joined
man will say on that day where is the place of escape
no there is no refuge
to your lord that day is the place of permanence
man will be informed that day of what he sent ahead and kept back
rather man against himself will be a witness
even if he presents his excuses
move not your tongue with it o muhammad to hasten with recitation of the qur an
indeed upon us is its collection in your heart and to make possible its recitation
so when we have recited it through gabriel then follow its recitation
then upon us is its clarification to you
no but you love the immediate
and leave the hereafter
some faces that day will be radiant
looking at their lord
and some faces that day will be contorted
expecting that there will be done to them something backbreaking
no when the soul has reached the collar bones
and it is said who will cure him
and the dying one is certain that it is the time of separation
and the leg is wound about the leg
to your lord that day will be the procession
and the disbeliever had not believed nor had he prayed
but instead he denied and turned away
and then he went to his people swaggering in pride
woe to you and woe
then woe to you and woe
does man think that he will be left neglected
had he not been a sperm from semen emitted
then he was a clinging clot and allah created his form and proportioned him
and made of him two mates the male and the female
is not that creator able to give life to the dead
has there not come upon man a period of time when he was not a thing even mentioned
indeed we created man from a sperm drop mixture that we may try him and we made him hearing and seeing
indeed we guided him to the way be he grateful or be he ungrateful
indeed we have prepared for the disbelievers chains and shackles and a blaze
indeed the righteous will drink from a cup of wine whose mixture is of kafur
a spring of which the righteous servants of allah will drink they will make it gush forth in force and abundance
they are those who fulfill their vows and fear a day whose evil will be widespread
and they give food in spite of love for it to the needy the orphan and the captive
saying we feed you only for the countenance of allah we wish not from you reward or gratitude
indeed we fear from our lord a day austere and distressful
so allah will protect them from the evil of that day and give them radiance and happiness
and will reward them for what they patiently endured with a garden in paradise and silk garments
they will be reclining therein on adorned couches they will not see therein any burning sun or freezing cold
and near above them are its shades and its fruit to be picked will be lowered in compliance
and there will be circulated among them vessels of silver and cups having been created clear as glass
clear glasses made from silver of which they have determined the measure
and they will be given to drink a cup of wine whose mixture is of ginger
from a fountain within paradise named salsabeel
there will circulate among them young boys made eternal when you see them you would think them as beautiful as scattered pearls
and when you look there in paradise you will see pleasure and great dominion
upon the inhabitants will be green garments of fine silk and brocade and they will be adorned with bracelets of silver and their lord will give them a purifying drink
and it will be said indeed this is for you a reward and your effort has been appreciated
indeed it is we who have sent down to you o muhammad the qur an progressively
so be patient for the decision of your lord and do not obey from among them a sinner or ungrateful disbeliever
and mention the name of your lord in prayer morning and evening
and during the night prostrate to him and exalt him a long part of the night
indeed these disbelievers love the immediate and leave behind them a grave day
we have created them and strengthened their forms and when we will we can change their likenesses with complete alteration
indeed this is a reminder so he who wills may take to his lord a way
and you do not will except that allah wills indeed allah is ever knowing and wise
he admits whom he wills into his mercy but the wrongdoers he has prepared for them a painful punishment
by those winds sent forth in gusts
and the winds that blow violently
and by the winds that spread clouds
and those angels who bring criterion
and those angels who deliver a message
as justification or warning
indeed what you are promised is to occur
so when the stars are obliterated
and when the heaven is opened
and when the mountains are blown away
and when the messengers time has come
for what day was it postponed
for the day of judgement
and what can make you know what is the day of judgement
woe that day to the deniers
did we not destroy the former peoples
then we will follow them with the later ones
thus do we deal with the criminals
woe that day to the deniers
did we not create you from a liquid disdained
and we placed it in a firm lodging
for a known extent
and we determined it and excellent are we to determine
woe that day to the deniers
have we not made the earth a container
of the living and the dead
and we placed therein lofty firmly set mountains and have given you to drink sweet water
woe that day to the deniers
they will be told proceed to that which you used to deny
proceed to a shadow of smoke having three columns
but having no cool shade and availing not against the flame
indeed it throws sparks as huge as a fortress
as if they were yellowish black camels
woe that day to the deniers
this is a day they will not speak
nor will it be permitted for them to make an excuse
woe that day to the deniers
this is the day of judgement we will have assembled you and the former peoples
so if you have a plan then plan against me
woe that day to the deniers
indeed the righteous will be among shades and springs
and fruits from whatever they desire
being told eat and drink in satisfaction for what you used to do
indeed we thus reward the doers of good
woe that day to the deniers
o disbelievers eat and enjoy yourselves a little indeed you are criminals
woe that day to the deniers
and when it is said to them bow in prayer they do not bow
woe that day to the deniers
then in what statement after the qur an will they believe
about what are they asking one another
about the great news
that over which they are in disagreement
no they are going to know
then no they are going to know
have we not made the earth a resting place
and the mountains as stakes
and we created you in pairs
and made your sleep a means for rest
and made the night as clothing
and made the day for livelihood
and constructed above you seven strong heavens
and made therein a burning lamp
and sent down from the rain clouds pouring water
that we may bring forth thereby grain and vegetation
and gardens of entwined growth
indeed the day of judgement is an appointed time
the day the horn is blown and you will come forth in multitudes
and the heaven is opened and will become gateways
and the mountains are removed and will be but a mirage
indeed hell has been lying in wait
for the transgressors a place of return
in which they will remain for ages unending
they will not taste therein any coolness or drink
except scalding water and foul purulence
an appropriate recompense
indeed they were not expecting an account
and denied our verses with emphatic denial
but all things we have enumerated in writing
so taste the penalty and never will we increase you except in torment
indeed for the righteous is attainment
gardens and grapevines
and full breasted companions of equal age
and a full cup
no ill speech will they hear therein or any falsehood
as reward from your lord a generous gift made due by account
from the lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them the most merciful they possess not from him authority for speech
the day that the spirit and the angels will stand in rows they will not speak except for one whom the most merciful permits and he will say what is correct
that is the true day so he who wills may take to his lord a way of return
indeed we have warned you of a near punishment on the day when a man will observe what his hands have put forth and the disbeliever will say oh i wish that i were dust
by those angels who extract with violence
and by those who remove with ease
and by those who glide as if swimming
and those who race each other in a race
and those who arrange each matter
on the day the blast of the horn will convulse creation
there will follow it the subsequent one
hearts that day will tremble
their eyes humbled
they are presently saying will we indeed be returned to our former state of life
even if we should be decayed bones
they say that then would be a losing return
indeed it will be but one shout
and suddenly they will be alert upon the earth s surface
has there reached you the story of moses
when his lord called to him in the sacred valley of tuwa
go to pharaoh indeed he has transgressed
and say to him would you be willing to purify yourself
and let me guide you to your lord so you would fear him
and he showed him the greatest sign
but pharaoh denied and disobeyed
then he turned his back striving
and he gathered his people and called out
and said i am your most exalted lord
so allah seized him in exemplary punishment for the last and the first transgression
indeed in that is a warning for whoever would fear allah
are you a more difficult creation or is the heaven allah constructed it
he raised its ceiling and proportioned it
and he darkened its night and extracted its brightness
and after that he spread the earth
he extracted from it its water and its pasture
and the mountains he set firmly
as provision for you and your grazing livestock
but when there comes the greatest overwhelming calamity
the day when man will remember that for which he strove
and hellfire will be exposed for all those who see
so as for he who transgressed
and preferred the life of the world
then indeed hellfire will be his refuge
but as for he who feared the position of his lord and prevented the soul from unlawful inclination
then indeed paradise will be his refuge
they ask you o muhammad about the hour when is its arrival
in what position are you that you should mention it
to your lord is its finality
you are only a warner for those who fear it
it will be on the day they see it as though they had not remained in the world except for an afternoon or a morning thereof
the prophet frowned and turned away
because there came to him the blind man interrupting
but what would make you perceive o muhammad that perhaps he might be purified
or be reminded and the remembrance would benefit him
as for he who thinks himself without need
to him you give attention
and not upon you is any blame if he will not be purified
but as for he who came to you striving for knowledge
while he fears allah
from him you are distracted
no indeed these verses are a reminder
so whoever wills may remember it
it is recorded in honored sheets
exalted and purified
carried by the hands of messenger angels
noble and dutiful
cursed is man how disbelieving is he
from what substance did he create him
from a sperm drop he created him and destined for him
then he eased the way for him
then he causes his death and provides a grave for him
then when he wills he will resurrect him
no man has not yet accomplished what he commanded him
then let mankind look at his food
how we poured down water in torrents
then we broke open the earth splitting it with sprouts
and caused to grow within it grain
and grapes and herbage
and olive and palm trees
and gardens of dense shrubbery
and fruit and grass
as enjoyment for you and your grazing livestock
but when there comes the deafening blast
on the day a man will flee from his brother
and his mother and his father
and his wife and his children
for every man that day will be a matter adequate for him
some faces that day will be bright
laughing rejoicing at good news
and other faces that day will have upon them dust
blackness will cover them
those are the disbelievers the wicked ones
when the sun is wrapped up in darkness
and when the stars fall dispersing
and when the mountains are removed
and when full term she camels are neglected
and when the wild beasts are gathered
and when the seas are filled with flame
and when the souls are paired
and when the girl who was buried alive is asked
for what sin she was killed
and when the pages are made public
and when the sky is stripped away
and when hellfire is set ablaze
and when paradise is brought near
a soul will then know what it has brought with it
so i swear by the retreating stars
those that run their courses and disappear
and by the night as it closes in
and by the dawn when it breathes
that indeed the qur an is a word conveyed by a noble messenger
who is possessed of power and with the owner of the throne secure in position
obeyed there in the heavens and trustworthy
and your companion is not at all mad
and he has already seen gabriel in the clear horizon
and muhammad is not a withholder of knowledge of the unseen
and the qur an is not the word of a devil expelled from the heavens
so where are you going
it is not except a reminder to the worlds
for whoever wills among you to take a right course
and you do not will except that allah wills lord of the worlds
when the sky breaks apart
and when the stars fall scattering
and when the seas are erupted
and when the contents of graves are scattered
a soul will then know what it has put forth and kept back
o mankind what has deceived you concerning your lord the generous
who created you proportioned you and balanced you
in whatever form he willed has he assembled you
no but you deny the recompense
and indeed appointed over you are keepers
noble and recording
they know whatever you do
indeed the righteous will be in pleasure
and indeed the wicked will be in hellfire
they will enter to burn therein on the day of recompense
and never therefrom will they be absent
and what can make you know what is the day of recompense
then what can make you know what is the day of recompense
it is the day when a soul will not possess for another soul power to do a thing and the command that day is entirely with allah
woe to those who give less than due
who when they take a measure from people take in full
but if they give by measure or by weight to them they cause loss
do they not think that they will be resurrected
for a tremendous day
the day when mankind will stand before the lord of the worlds
no indeed the record of the wicked is in sijjeen
and what can make you know what is sijjeen
it is their destination recorded in a register inscribed
woe that day to the deniers
who deny the day of recompense
and none deny it except every sinful transgressor
when our verses are recited to him he says legends of the former peoples
no rather the stain has covered their hearts of that which they were earning
no indeed from their lord that day they will be partitioned
then indeed they will enter and burn in hellfire
then it will be said to them this is what you used to deny
no indeed the record of the righteous is in illiyyun
and what can make you know what is illiyyun
it is their destination recorded in a register inscribed
which is witnessed by those brought near to allah
indeed the righteous will be in pleasure
on adorned couches observing
you will recognize in their faces the radiance of pleasure
they will be given to drink pure wine which was sealed
the last of it is musk so for this let the competitors compete
and its mixture is of tasneem
a spring from which those near to allah drink
indeed those who committed crimes used to laugh at those who believed
and when they passed by them they would exchange derisive glances
and when they returned to their people they would return jesting
and when they saw them they would say indeed those are truly lost
but they had not been sent as guardians over them
so today those who believed are laughing at the disbelievers
on adorned couches observing
have the disbelievers not been rewarded this day for what they used to do
when the sky has split open
and has responded to its lord and was obligated to do so
and when the earth has been extended
and has cast out that within it and relinquished it
and has responded to its lord and was obligated to do so
o mankind indeed you are laboring toward your lord with great exertion and will meet it
then as for he who is given his record in his right hand
he will be judged with an easy account
and return to his people in happiness
but as for he who is given his record behind his back
he will cry out for destruction
and enter to burn in a blaze
indeed he had once been among his people in happiness
indeed he had thought he would never return to allah
but yes indeed his lord was ever of him seeing
so i swear by the twilight glow
and by the night and what it envelops
and by the moon when it becomes full
that you will surely experience state after state
so what is the matter with them that they do not believe
and when the qur an is recited to them they do not prostrate to allah
but those who have disbelieved deny
and allah is most knowing of what they keep within themselves
so give them tidings of a painful punishment
except for those who believe and do righteous deeds for them is a reward uninterrupted
by the sky containing great stars
and by the promised day
and by the witness and what is witnessed
cursed were the companions of the trench
containing the fire full of fuel
when they were sitting near it
and they to what they were doing against the believers were witnesses
and they resented them not except because they believed in allah the exalted in might the praiseworthy
to whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and allah over all things is witness
indeed those who have tortured the believing men and believing women and then have not repented will have the punishment of hell and they will have the punishment of the burning fire
indeed those who have believed and done righteous deeds will have gardens beneath which rivers flow that is the great attainment
indeed the vengeance of your lord is severe
indeed it is he who originates creation and repeats
and he is the forgiving the affectionate
honorable owner of the throne
effecter of what he intends
has there reached you the story of the soldiers
those of pharaoh and thamud
but they who disbelieve are in persistent denial
while allah encompasses them from behind
but this is an honored qur an
inscribed in a preserved slate
by the sky and the night comer
and what can make you know what is the night comer
it is the piercing star
there is no soul but that it has over it a protector
so let man observe from what he was created
he was created from a fluid ejected
emerging from between the backbone and the ribs
indeed allah to return him to life is able
the day when secrets will be put on trial
then man will have no power or any helper
by the sky which returns rain
and by the earth which cracks open
indeed the qur an is a decisive statement
and it is not amusement
indeed they are planning a plan
but i am planning a plan
so allow time for the disbelievers leave them awhile
exalt the name of your lord the most high
who created and proportioned
and who destined and then guided
and who brings out the pasture
and then makes it black stubble
we will make you recite o muhammad and you will not forget
except what allah should will indeed he knows what is declared and what is hidden
and we will ease you toward ease
so remind if the reminder should benefit
he who fears allah will be reminded
but the wretched one will avoid it
he who will enter and burn in the greatest fire
neither dying therein nor living
he has certainly succeeded who purifies himself
and mentions the name of his lord and prays
but you prefer the worldly life
while the hereafter is better and more enduring
indeed this is in the former scriptures
the scriptures of abraham and moses
has there reached you the report of the overwhelming event
some faces that day will be humbled
working hard and exhausted
they will enter to burn in an intensely hot fire
they will be given drink from a boiling spring
for them there will be no food except from a poisonous thorny plant
which neither nourishes nor avails against hunger
other faces that day will show pleasure
with their effort they are satisfied
in an elevated garden
wherein they will hear no unsuitable speech
within it is a flowing spring
within it are couches raised high
and cups put in place
and cushions lined up
and carpets spread around
then do they not look at the camels how they are created
and at the sky how it is raised
and at the mountains how they are erected
and at the earth how it is spread out
so remind o muhammad you are only a reminder
you are not over them a controller
however he who turns away and disbelieves
then allah will punish him with the greatest punishment
indeed to us is their return
then indeed upon us is their account
by the dawn
and by ten nights
and by the even number and the odd
and by the night when it passes
is there not in all that an oath sufficient for one of perception
have you not considered how your lord dealt with aad
with iram who had lofty pillars
the likes of whom had never been created in the land
and with thamud who carved out the rocks in the valley
and with pharaoh owner of the stakes
all of whom oppressed within the lands
and increased therein the corruption
so your lord poured upon them a scourge of punishment
indeed your lord is in observation
and as for man when his lord tries him and thus is generous to him and favors him he says my lord has honored me
but when he tries him and restricts his provision he says my lord has humiliated me
no but you do not honor the orphan
and you do not encourage one another to feed the poor
and you consume inheritance devouring it altogether
and you love wealth with immense love
no when the earth has been leveled pounded and crushed
and your lord has come and the angels rank upon rank
and brought within view that day is hell that day man will remember but what good to him will be the remembrance
he will say oh i wish i had sent ahead some good for my life
so on that day none will punish as severely as his punishment
and none will bind as severely as his binding of the evildoers
to the righteous it will be said o reassured soul
return to your lord well pleased and pleasing to him
and enter among my righteous servants
and enter my paradise
i swear by this city makkah
and you o muhammad are free of restriction in this city
and by the father and that which was born of him
we have certainly created man into hardship
does he think that never will anyone overcome him
he says i have spent wealth in abundance
does he think that no one has seen him
have we not made for him two eyes
and a tongue and two lips
and have shown him the two ways
but he has not broken through the difficult pass
and what can make you know what is breaking through the difficult pass
it is the freeing of a slave
or feeding on a day of severe hunger
an orphan of near relationship
or a needy person in misery
and then being among those who believed and advised one another to patience and advised one another to compassion
those are the companions of the right
but they who disbelieved in our signs those are the companions of the left
over them will be fire closed in
by the sun and its brightness
and by the moon when it follows it
and by the day when it displays it
and by the night when it covers it
and by the sky and he who constructed it
and by the earth and he who spread it
and by the soul and he who proportioned it
and inspired it with discernment of its wickedness and its righteousness
he has succeeded who purifies it
and he has failed who instills it with corruption
thamud denied their prophet by reason of their transgression
when the most wretched of them was sent forth
and the messenger of allah salih said to them do not harm the she camel of allah or prevent her from her drink
but they denied him and hamstrung her so their lord brought down upon them destruction for their sin and made it equal upon all of them
and he does not fear the consequence thereof
by the night when it covers
and by the day when it appears
and by he who created the male and female
indeed your efforts are diverse
as for he who gives and fears allah
and believes in the best reward
we will ease him toward ease
but as for he who withholds and considers himself free of need
and denies the best reward
we will ease him toward difficulty
and what will his wealth avail him when he falls
indeed incumbent upon us is guidance
and indeed to us belongs the hereafter and the first life
so i have warned you of a fire which is blazing
none will enter to burn therein except the most wretched one
who had denied and turned away
but the righteous one will avoid it
he who gives from his wealth to purify himself
and not giving for anyone who has done him a favor to be rewarded
but only seeking the countenance of his lord most high
and he is going to be satisfied
by the morning brightness
and by the night when it covers with darkness
your lord has not taken leave of you o muhammad nor has he detested you
and the hereafter is better for you than the first life
and your lord is going to give you and you will be satisfied
did he not find you an orphan and give you refuge
and he found you lost and guided you
and he found you poor and made you self sufficient
so as for the orphan do not oppress him
and as for the petitioner do not repel him
but as for the favor of your lord report it
did we not expand for you o muhammad your breast
and we removed from you your burden
which had weighed upon your back
and raised high for you your repute
for indeed with hardship will be ease
indeed with hardship will be ease
so when you have finished your duties then stand up for worship
and to your lord direct your longing
by the fig and the olive
and by mount sinai
and by this secure city makkah
we have certainly created man in the best of stature
then we return him to the lowest of the low
except for those who believe and do righteous deeds for they will have a reward uninterrupted
so what yet causes you to deny the recompense
is not allah the most just of judges
recite in the name of your lord who created
created man from a clinging substance
recite and your lord is the most generous
who taught by the pen
taught man that which he knew not
no but indeed man transgresses
because he sees himself self sufficient
indeed to your lord is the return
have you seen the one who forbids
a servant when he prays
have you seen if he is upon guidance
or enjoins righteousness
have you seen if he denies and turns away
does he not know that allah sees
no if he does not desist we will surely drag him by the forelock
a lying sinning forelock
then let him call his associates
we will call the angels of hell
no do not obey him but prostrate and draw near to allah
indeed we sent the qur an down during the night of decree
and what can make you know what is the night of decree
the night of decree is better than a thousand months
the angels and the spirit descend therein by permission of their lord for every matter
peace it is until the emergence of dawn
those who disbelieved among the people of the scripture and the polytheists were not to be parted from misbelief until there came to them clear evidence
a messenger from allah reciting purified scriptures
within which are correct writings
nor did those who were given the scripture become divided until after there had come to them clear evidence
and they were not commanded except to worship allah being sincere to him in religion inclining to truth and to establish prayer and to give zakah and that is the correct religion
indeed they who disbelieved among the people of the scripture and the polytheists will be in the fire of hell abiding eternally therein those are the worst of creatures
indeed they who have believed and done righteous deeds those are the best of creatures
their reward with allah will be gardens of perpetual residence beneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide forever allah being pleased with them and they with him that is for whoever has feared his lord
when the earth is shaken with its final earthquake
and the earth discharges its burdens
and man says what is wrong with it
that day it will report its news
because your lord has commanded it
that day the people will depart separated into categories to be shown the result of their deeds
so whoever does an atom s weight of good will see it
and whoever does an atom s weight of evil will see it
by the racers panting
and the producers of sparks when striking
and the chargers at dawn
stirring up thereby clouds of dust
arriving thereby in the center collectively
indeed mankind to his lord is ungrateful
and indeed he is to that a witness
and indeed he is in love of wealth intense
but does he not know that when the contents of the graves are scattered
and that within the breasts is obtained
indeed their lord with them that day is fully acquainted
the striking calamity
what is the striking calamity
and what can make you know what is the striking calamity
it is the day when people will be like moths dispersed
and the mountains will be like wool fluffed up
then as for one whose scales are heavy with good deeds
he will be in a pleasant life
but as for one whose scales are light
his refuge will be an abyss
and what can make you know what that is
it is a fire intensely hot
competition in worldly increase diverts you
until you visit the graveyards
no you are going to know
then no you are going to know
no if you only knew with knowledge of certainty
you will surely see the hellfire
then you will surely see it with the eye of certainty
then you will surely be asked that day about pleasure
by time
indeed mankind is in loss
except for those who have believed and done righteous deeds and advised each other to truth and advised each other to patience
woe to every scorner and mocker
who collects wealth and continuously counts it
he thinks that his wealth will make him immortal
no he will surely be thrown into the crusher
and what can make you know what is the crusher
it is the fire of allah eternally fueled
which mounts directed at the hearts
indeed hellfire will be closed down upon them
in extended columns
have you not considered o muhammad how your lord dealt with the companions of the elephant
did he not make their plan into misguidance
and he sent against them birds in flocks
striking them with stones of hard clay
and he made them like eaten straw
for the accustomed security of the quraysh
their accustomed security in the caravan of winter and summer
let them worship the lord of this house
who has fed them saving them from hunger and made them safe saving them from fear
have you seen the one who denies the recompense
for that is the one who drives away the orphan
and does not encourage the feeding of the poor
so woe to those who pray
but who are heedless of their prayer
those who make show of their deeds
and withhold simple assistance
indeed we have granted you o muhammad al kawthar
so pray to your lord and sacrifice to him alone
indeed your enemy is the one cut off
say o disbelievers
i do not worship what you worship
nor are you worshippers of what i worship
nor will i be a worshipper of what you worship
nor will you be worshippers of what i worship
for you is your religion and for me is my religion
when the victory of allah has come and the conquest
and you see the people entering into the religion of allah in multitudes
then exalt him with praise of your lord and ask forgiveness of him indeed he is ever accepting of repentance
may the hands of abu lahab be ruined and ruined is he
his wealth will not avail him or that which he gained
he will enter to burn in a fire of blazing flame
and his wife as well the carrier of firewood
around her neck is a rope of twisted fiber
say he is allah who is one
allah the eternal refuge
he neither begets nor is born
nor is there to him any equivalent
say i seek refuge in the lord of daybreak
from the evil of that which he created
and from the evil of darkness when it settles
and from the evil of the blowers in knots
and from the evil of an envier when he envies
say i seek refuge in the lord of mankind
the sovereign of mankind
the god of mankind
from the evil of the retreating whisperer
who whispers evil into the breasts of mankind
from among the jinn and mankind
